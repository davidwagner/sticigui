	General Instructions for Assignments
</H2>

<p>
Your browser must be configured to accept cookies, to allow
pop-up windows and, to use JavaScript and Java.
Generally, it is a good idea to set up your browser
to verify each document every time it is loaded, rather than to use a
cached copy.
That will ensure that you have the most up-to-date
version of every assignment.
</p>
<p>
SticiGui assignments combine forms, instructions, and interactive
tools to reinforce the material presented in the chapters and to
assess your understanding. The assignments use two <EM>frames</EM>.
The upper frame has the instructions and a form for your responses;
the bottom frame has tools you might need to solve the problems, such
as graphs, calculators, <EM>etc</EM>.
</p>
<p>To access the assignments, you must provide the following
identifying information:
</p>
<p class="center">
    last name, first name, student ID, email address.
</p>
<p>
   At the bottom of the instruction frame, after all the questions,
   there are three buttons: one to submit the assignment for grading,
   one to save your intermediate results on your computer, and one to
    clear the answer form.
</p>
<p class="center">
   <strong>You must click the submit button to send your
   answers to be graded.</strong>
</p>
<p class="center">
   <strong>After you click the submit button, you must
   click another button to confirm that you <em>really</em> want to submit
   your answers for grading. </strong>
<p>

<p>
   Click the &quot;OK&quot; button once only&mdash;if you double-click, it will submit
   your answers twice and you will lose one of your chances to submit the assignment.
</p>

<p>
   The window that contained the problem set will show a confirmation screen (from AutoGrader) giving your
   score and telling you how many times you have submitted the problem set so far.
   It might take up to 30 seconds for the confirmation screen to appear, depending on web and server traffic.
   Be patient.
   If you get the confirmation screen, the server definitely received your submission.
   You can also see your scores by clicking the &quot;My Scores on Past Assignments&quot; button near the top of this
   page, just below where you type in your login information.
</p>
<p>
   <strong>After the due date, there will be no &quot;submit&quot;
   button.</strong> If the submit button is missing, but the assignment
   is not yet due, the clock on your computer is mis-set.
   Your computer's clock needs to be set to the time zone that the course is taught in
   (Pacific Time, if this is a UC Berkeley course),
   and to the correct day.
   If it is not, re-set the clock, clear the browser's cache, and re-start the browser.
   The submit button will come back.
   (In Firefox 13 on the mac, to clear the cache go to the Firefox-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Privacy menu.
	There's a link for &quot;clear all current history.&quot;
    Click that link.
    That brings up a dialog box with tic boxes.
    Tic the boxes for cookies, cache, and offline website data, then the &quot;Clear Now&quot;
    button.)
</p>
<p>
   <a href="#gradeQuery" target="_self">To see your grades</a>, you
   need to enter your name, email address, and SID, to protect your
   privacy.
   Click the button just under the assignment list, near the
   top of this page.
   Also, if you go back to the assignment after the
   due date, you can see the correct answers to your unique version of
   the assignment.
</p>

<p>
   Many of the questions and data in assignments have a random component.
   Different students get different questions and different data.
   You are graded based on the questions and data you receive.
   Differences in question wording can be subtle: If you work with other students,
   be sure to answer your version of the question.
</p>

<p>
   You can save intermediate results on the assignment using a button
   at the bottom of the instruction page&mdash;sort of.
   The assignments also save themselves as a cookie on your computer when you submit them.
   Because the cookie is stored on <em>your</em> computer, you cannot access the
   answers from a different computer (or even a different browser on your computer).
   <strong>Warning: Cookies are volatile, not reliable.
   Some events will cause or require your cookies to be
   deleted.
   And they &quot;expire&quot; after a few days.
   Always write down your answers on paper in case the cookie is deleted.</strong>
   You've been warned.
</p>

<p>
   You can use different computers for different assignments.
   After filling out the identifying information at the top of
   this page to access the assignments, your browser will look
   for a cookie with a record of your previous work on the assignment
   <strong>on your computer</strong>.
   If it finds a cookie, the assignment will fill in your previous answers.
   That is the <em>last</em> thing that happens when the assignment loads.
   Be patient.
   Do not scroll, click or type while the assignment page is still loading.
   If the computers does not find a cookie, the answer fields will be blank.
</p>


<p>
   <strong>Questions with multiple-choice answers.</strong>
   There are two types of questions with multiple-choice answers.
The first kind allows you to select only one response.
The second kind asks you to &quot;select all that apply.&quot;
How to select more than one answer depends on the computer operating
system and browser.
In Firefox on unix and linux systems, click each answer you want to select;
clicking an answer again de-selects it.
On Windows systems, hold down
the control (ctrl) key while clicking each response to select more
than one.
On Macintosh systems, hold down the &quot;command&quot; key while you click
to select multiple responses.
   In such &quot;multiple-multiple-choice&quot;
   questions, if you select an answer that is not correct, or fail to
   select one that is correct, you will not receive credit&mdash;there is no
   partial credit.
</p>
<p>
   <strong>Numerical answers.</strong>
   The grader strips commas from
   numbers, so you are free to punctuate numerical responses.
   If your response includes a percent sign at the end, your numerical answer
   will be converted to a percentage (divided by 100).
   Scientific notation (e.g., 4.23e-7 as shorthand for 0.000000423) will work; do
   not put a space between the digits and the letter &quot;e.&quot;
   Questions that do not have an exact numerical answer accept a small
   range of answers as correct.
   The precision required depends on the problem statement.
   When in doubt, don't round off your final answer.
   In this class, there is no such thing as an answer that is &quot;too
   precise.&quot;
   <strong>Never round off intermediate calculations</strong>.
</p>
<p>
   The chapter exercises accept arithmetic expressions as answers, but these
   submitted homework assignments, graded by the server, do not.
   For instance, if the answer is supposed to be 50%, the SticiGui in-chapter
   exercises will accept 50%, 0.5, 1/2, 50/100, 1/sqrt(4), etc.,
   as correct.
   But the homework assignments&mdash;the problems you access through this login page&mdash;will
   only accept 50% or 0.5.
   The server will count 50/100 or 1/sqrt(4) as wrong answers.
</p>


<h2>
	<a id="troubleshooting" title="troubleshooting"></a>Troubleshooting
</h2>

<p>
	Most technical problems with the online book and assignments
	have one of three causes:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		Using a browser that is not supported, or that is not configured
		correctly.
		See <a href="../minimum.htm"
		     title="minimum requirements to run SticiGui" target="_new">minimum system
		     requirements to run SticiGui</a>.
	</li>
	<li>
		Scrolling, clicking or typing before the assignment page is fully loaded.
		Be sure to wait until the page has loaded completely before you do anything.
                The cursor should be normal, no hourglass or spinning wheel.
                The status bar should have a message like &quot;done&quot; or &quot;loaded.&quot;
	</li>
	<li>
		Corrupted cookies or cookies that have grown too big.
		See <a href="#cookies" title="cookies">cookies</a>.
	</li>
</ol>


<p>
    <strong>If you can't log in</strong>, be sure you selected your course from the drop-down menu.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>If the submit button is missing but it is before the due date</strong>,
    the clock or calendar on your computer is set incorrectly.
    Your clock needs to be set to the time zone in which the problems are assigned (probably Pacific Time)
    <em>and to the correct day</em>.
    If it is not, re-set the clock, clear the browser's cache, and re-start the browser.
    The submit button will come back.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>If the server says you have submitted the assignment more times than you remember submitting
    it</strong>, you might have double-clicked the &quot;OK&quot; button.
    The server cannot mis-count the number of times you submitted the assignment.
</p>

<p>
   If, when you try to access the problem sets, you get an error message that starts like this,
   delete the cookies (see below):
</p>

<pre>
             Bad Request

             Your browser sent a request that this server could not understand.
             Size of a request header field exceeds server limit.

<h3>

	Cookies
</h3>

<p class="inline">
   Cookies are small text files stored on your computer.
   SticiGui uses cookies to store your answers to assignments to homework assignments
   on your computer and to remember your student ID when you log in to do an
   assignment or check your scores.
</p>
</div>

<p>
   Cookies are not reliable: many things will cause them to be deleted or require them
   to be deleted.
   You might get an error message that you need to clear
   the cookies in your browser.
   When you delete the cookies, the answers stored on your computer will be erased,
   but the server will still retain your submitted answers and your scores&mdash;only
   the record on your computer is affected.
   Current browsers allow you to delete cookies easily, but the command is in
   different menus in different browsers and on different operating systems.
