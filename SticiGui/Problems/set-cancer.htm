    Assignment 0: Why Statistics
</h1>


<p><center><b>Breast Cancer in Cape Cod</b></center>

<p>Many people make use of simple statistical summaries such as means and
proportions, as well as graphical displays, to present their data. In this
problem you will learn a little about breast cancer rates in the Cape Cod
area of&nbsp; Massachusettes and be asked to interpret some of findings
from a study. As with the examples in Chapter 0 this problem is a real-life
example of where statistics plays a crucial role.

<p>The <a HREF="http://www.silentspring.org/">Silent Spring Institute</a>
researches potential environmental associations with breast cancer. Its
first major project was an investigation of breast cancer rates in Cape
Cod.. The impetus for the Cape Cod project was a report by the Massachussets
Department of Public Health which reported that between 1982-1994 the towns
in&nbsp; Cape Cod had higher breast cancer rates than the rest of the state.

<p>Link to the <a HREF="http://www.silentspring.org/Projects/Capestudy/Capebrca.html">town
map of Massachussettes</a> that shows the towns that were found to statistically
differ from the overall state breast cancer rate. For the purposes of this
question it is not important to know exactly what rate was used or what
is meant by a statistically significant elevation. Suffice it to say that
the data strongly <i>suggested</i> that something in Cape Cod was going
on that wasn't in the rest of the state.
<p><!--Q--><font COLOR="#008000">What in
the map tells you that Cape Cod had higher breast cancer rates than the
rest of the state?&nbsp;
<select name="Q1" size="1">
<option value=" "></option>
<option value="A">A:The blue hash marks</option>&nbsp;
<option value="B">B: 60% of Cape Cod towns had elevated rates</option>&nbsp;
<option value="C">C: 7% of non-Cape Cod towns had elevated rates</option>&nbsp;
<option value="D">D: Comparison of Cape Cod rate (60%) with non-Cape Cod rate (7%)</option>&nbsp;
</select><!--/Q-->
<!--A--><input type="hidden" name="A1" value="D"><!--/A--></font>
<br />&nbsp;
<br />&nbsp;To compare breast cancer risk across towns the investigators
used a statistic known as the standardized incidence ratio (SIR), a commonly
used tool for comparing disease rates. Incidence is the number of newly
diagnosed cases in a given location (here, town) during a given time period
(here, 1982-1994). The term &quot;ratio&quot; appears in SIR because it is necessary
to account for different town population sizes. For example, suppose Town
A has 10 new cases of cancer, while Town B has 5 new cases of cancer in
a certain time period. Which town has a bigger cancer problem? It's hard
to tell without knowing the town population sizes. If Town A has 1,000
people and Town B has 50 people, then 1 in 100 people in Town A were diagnosed
with cancer, while&nbsp; the rate was 10 in 100 people in Town B. Therfore,
based on just these numbers, or statistics, Town B has a bigger cancer
probnlem even though they have fewer (5 &lt; 10) cancer cases. Although
the SIR is not calculated in the same way, this example illustrates the
idea of accounting for population size when comparing disease cases across
different locations.

<p>Read about how the <a HREF="http://www.silentspring.org/Projects/Capestudy/SIRs/SIRs.html">Cape
Cod project used the SIR statistic </a>to track the progression of breast
cancer on the Cape as compared to the rest of the state.

<p><!--Q--><font COLOR="#008000">If in a certain town had 60 new breast cancer cases between 1982 and
1994 when they actually expected 80, what would be the SIR for that town?

<p><!--Q--><font COLOR="#008000">The graph shows that all SIRs calculated for the years 1982-1994

<p>A risk factor for a disease is something that has been found to be associated
with the disease, but necessarily causing the disease. In trying to explain why the
breast cancer rates are higher on Cape Cod than non-Cape Massachusettes researchers
frequently ask whether known risk factors could be responsible for the obsereved rate
differences. For excample, age is a known risk factor: breast cancer is more common in
older women than in younger women. Therefore, since Cape Cod is home to
many retirees, this may explain the rate difference and not anything unique or intrinsic
to Cape Cod, such as the air in the Cape. Trying to determine if the rate differences could
be explained by known risk factors is a statistical problem to which their are both simple
and elaborate approaches. The Cape Cod project investiagted whether age could
explain the patterns of breast cancer incidence on Cape Cod.
<a HREF="http://www.silentspring.org/Projects/Capestudy/SIRs/SIRs.html">
Read this discussion</a> and then answer the following question.

<p><!--Q--><font COLOR="#008000">It was decided that age was not responsible for the
rate differences because&nbsp;
<select name="Q6" size="1">
<option value=" "></option>
<option value="A">A: the SIRs were standardized (adjusted) for age</option>&nbsp;
<option value="B">B: there were few retired women on Cape Cod</option>&nbsp;
<option value="C">C: the study did not include women older than 50 years</option>&nbsp;
<option value="D">D: people also retire to non-Cape Massachusettes</option>&nbsp;
</select><!--/Q--><!--A--><input type="hidden" name="A6" value="A"><!--/A--></font>
<br />&nbsp;


<p>Because of concerns about elevated breast cancer rates,
screening for breast cancer could have been intensified on Cape Cod. This might explain the
higher reported incidence on the Cape. However, the study's findings show that differences
in screening do not account for elevated breast cancer incidence on Cape Cod.

<p><!--Q--><font COLOR="#008000">This conclusion
was reached by comparing the proportion of women with breast cancer on Cape Cod who were
diagnosed at Stage III to the proportion of women with breast cancer elsewhere in Massachusetts
who were diagnosed at Stage III.&nbsp;
