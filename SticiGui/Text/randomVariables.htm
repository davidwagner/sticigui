    introduced the sample sum of random draws with replacement from a box of tickets,
    each of which is labeled &quot;0&quot; or &quot;1.&quot;
    The sample sum is a random variable, and its probability distribution,
    the binomial distribution, is a discrete probability distribution.
    This chapter introduces several other random variables and
    probability distributions that arise from drawing at random from
    a box of tickets numbered &quot;0&quot; or &quot;1:&quot; the geometric distribution,
    the negative binomial distribution, and the hypergeometric distribution.

<p>
    A <em>random variable</em> is an assignment of numbers to <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#outcome">outcomes</a>
    of a <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#random_experiment">random experiment</a>.
    For example, consider the experiment of drawing tickets at random
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#independent">independently</a> from a box of numbered tickets.
    The possible outcomes of <em>n</em> such draws are <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#sequence">sequences</a>
    of <em>n</em> tickets in a particular order.
    The <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#sample_sum">sample sum</a> of the numbers on the tickets drawn,
    which was introduced in the previous chapter, is a random variable.
    Depending on the sequence of tickets drawn,
    the sample sum takes different values.
    To any particular sequence of <em>n</em> tickets, the sample sum assigns the sum of their
    labels.
    The sample sum does not distinguish between sequences of tickets in which other
    tickets with the same labels were drawn, nor in which the tickets were
    drawn in a different order: The sample sum depends only on the <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#set">set</a>
    of labels on the tickets drawn.
</p>

<p>
    In this book, upper-case Roman letters are used to denote random variables; for example,
    X might stand for the sample sum of 5 independent random draws with replacement
    from a box containing one ticket labeled &quot;1&quot; and one ticket labeled &quot;0.&quot;
    In that case, the random variable X would have a <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#binomial">binomial
    distribution</a> with parameters <em>n</em> = 5 and <em>p</em> = 50%.
    A random variable is not a variable in the same sense the word is used in
    calculus or algebra: It is something that takes a random value, depending on the
    outcome of a random experiment.
</p>

<p>
    The <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#prob_distribution">probability distribution</a>
    of a (discrete) random variable gives the chances that
    the random variable takes each of its possible values.
    That is, for every value <em>x</em> that the random variable X can take,
    the probability distribution of X gives P(X=<em>x</em>).
    The probability distribution can be written either as a formula
    (a function of <em>x</em>), or a table.
    For example, in the case just described, we might write the
    probability distribution of X as
</p>

<p class="math">
    P(X=<em>x</em>) = <sub>5</sub>C<sub><em>x</em></sub> &times;
    (1/2)<sup>5</sup>, <em>x</em>=0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
</p>

<p>
    or as the following table:
</p>

<div align="center"><center>
    <table class="dataTable">
        <caption>Probability distribution of X</caption>
        <tr>
            <th id="col0"> <em>x</em> </th>
            <th id="col1"> P(X = <em>x</em>)</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td headers="col0"> 0 </td>
            <td headers="col1">1/32 </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
             <td headers="col0"> 1 </td>
             <td headers="col1">5/32 </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
             <td headers="col0">2 </td>
             <td headers="col1">10/32 </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
             <td headers="col0">3 </td>
             <td headers="col1">10/32 </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
             <td headers="col0">4 </td>
             <td headers="col1">5/32 </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
             <td headers="col0">5 </td>
             <td headers="col1">1/32 </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</center>

<p>
    We proceed to investigate some discrete
    probability distributions that arise frequently in practical problems.
</p>

<h2><a id="0_1_boxes"></a>Sampling from 0-1 Boxes</h2>

<p>
    Recall that a box of numbered tickets is a <em>0-1 box</em>
    if each ticket in the box is numbered either &quot;0&quot; or &quot;1.&quot;
    Suppose that a 0-1 box contains <em>N</em> tickets in all, of which <em>G</em> are labeled &quot;1&quot;
    and the remaining <em>N</em>&minus;<em>G</em> are labeled &quot;0,&quot; so that the fraction of tickets
    in the box labeled &quot;1&quot; is <em>p</em>=<em>G</em>/<em>N</em>.
<script language="JavaScript1.4" type="text/javascript"><!--
    document.writeln(citeLinkChapter('montyHallTest') + ', ');
// -->
</script>
    shows
    that the sample sum of <em>n</em> random draws with replacement from that box has a
    binomial distribution with parameters <em>n</em> and <em>p</em>.
    Many other interesting random variables arise in sampling from 0-1 boxes.
    This section presents three: the number of random draws with replacement until
    the first time a ticket labeled &quot;1&quot; is drawn (which has a <em>geometric</em> distribution),
    the number of random draws with replacement until the <em>r</em>th time a ticket
    labeled &quot;1&quot; is drawn (which has a <em>negative binomial</em> distribution),
    and the sample sum of <em>n</em> random draws without replacement
    (which has an <em>hypergeometric</em> distribution).

<h3><a id="geometric_distribution"></a>
    The Geometric Distribution
</h3>

<p class="video"> <iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/_ld1AeKfV5A?start=1123&end=1790" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</p>
   
<p>
    The number of random draws with replacement from a 0-1 box until the first time a ticket
    labeled &quot;1&quot; is drawn is a random variable with a geometric distribution with parameter
    <em>p</em>=<em>G</em>/<em>N</em>, where <em>G</em> 
    is the number of tickets labeled &quot;1&quot; in the box and <em>N</em> is the
    total number of tickets in the box.
    This subsection finds the geometric distribution.
</p>

<p>
    Consider the number of times one must roll a fair die up to and including the
    first time the die lands with one spot on top.
    A box model for this experiment would be to draw tickets at random with
    replacement from a 0-1 box that contains <em>N</em>=6 tickets of which <em>G</em>=1 are
    labeled &quot;1&quot; and <em>N</em>&minus;<em>G</em>=5 are labeled &quot;0,&quot; until the first time the
    ticket labeled &quot;1&quot; is drawn.
</p>

<div class="boxModel">
   <p class="boxLabel">
      Box for a fair die to land showing 1 spot
   </p>
   <div class="boxContents">
      <p class="boxTickets">0</p>
      <p class="boxTickets">0</p>
      <p class="boxTickets">0</p>

      <p class="boxTickets">0</p>
      <p class="boxTickets">1</p>
   </div>
</div>

<p>
    Let X denote the number of draws until the first time a ticket labeled &quot;1&quot; is drawn,
    including the draw that yields the ticket labeled &quot;1.&quot;
    The random variable X does not have a binomial distribution:
    The number of draws is not fixed in advance, and the quantity of
    interest is the number of draws, not the sample sum of the numbers on the tickets drawn.
</p>

<p>
    Let us calculate the probability distribution of X.
    It is impossible for X to be less than one: It takes at least one draw to get the
    ticket labeled &quot;1.&quot;
    The chance that it takes exactly one draw to get the ticket labeled &quot;1&quot;&mdash;the chance
    that X=1&mdash;is 1/6.
    What is the chance that X=2?
    For X=2 to occur, the first draw must give a ticket labeled &quot;0&quot; and the
    second draw must give the ticket labeled &quot;1.&quot;
    Because the draws are independent, the chance that these two things occur
    (draw &quot;0&quot; the first time and &quot;1&quot; the second time) equals the product
    of their individual unconditional chances.
    The chance of drawing &quot;0&quot; the first time is 5/6, and the chance of
    drawing &quot;1&quot; the second time is 1/6, so the chance that it takes two
    draws is 5/6&times;1/6 = 5/36.
</p>

<p>
    What is the chance that X=3?
    The event X=3 occurs if the first draw gives &quot;0,&quot; the second draw
    gives &quot;0,&quot; and the
    third draw gives &quot;1.&quot;
    Because the draws are independent, the event X=3 has chance 5/6&times;5/6 &times;1/6=25/216.
</p>

<p>
    For X to equal <em>x</em>, we first need to have <em>x</em>&minus;1 draws that
    give a ticket labeled &quot;0&quot; (these each have probability 5/6), then a draw that
    gives the ticket labeled &quot;1&quot; (which has probability 1/6).
    Because the draws are <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#independent">independent</a>,
    we can multiply the chances of
    these outcomes to determine the chance that they all happen together
    (the chance of their <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#intersection">intersection</a>).
    Thus the general formula is
</p>

<p class="math">
    P(X = <em>x</em>) = (5/6)<sup><em>x</em>&minus;1</sup> &times; (1/6),
    <em>x</em> = 1, 2, 3, &hellip; .
</p>


<p>
    Let X be the number of trials to the first success in
    independent trials with the same probability <em>p</em> of success.
    Then X behaves like the number of times one needs to draw
    tickets at random with replacement from a 0-1 box that contains
    a proportion <em>p</em>=<em>G</em>/<em>N</em> of tickets labeled &quot;1.&quot;
    X is a random variable with a <em>geometric distribution with parameter</em> <em>p</em>, and
</p>

<p class="math">
    P(X = <em>x</em>) = (1 &minus; <em>p</em>)<sup><em>x</em>&minus;1</sup> &times; <em>p</em>,
    for <em>x</em> = 1, 2, 3,  &hellip;  .
</p>

<p>
    The die-rolling example is the special case <em>p</em> = 1/6.
    Note that a random variable that has the geometric distribution has an infinite
    (but countable) number of possible values: all the positive integers.
    The sum of the chances that a random variable with the geometric distribution
    takes the values 0, 1, 2, 3,  &hellip; , is 100%:
</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
    The essential requirement for a random variable to have the geometric distribution
    is that it counts the number of trials to the first success
    in independent trials with the same probability <em>p</em> of success
    in each trial.
    If we identify &quot;success&quot; with drawing a ticket labeled &quot;1&quot;
    from a 0-1 box, and identify &quot;failure&quot; with drawing a ticket
    labeled &quot;0&quot; from the box, each draw can be thought of as a trial
    that results in success or failure.
    If we draw at random independently with replacement, the trials are
    independent and have the same probability <em>p</em> of success (the proportion
    <em>p</em>=<em>G</em>/<em>N</em> of tickets labeled &quot;1&quot; does not
    change from draw to draw).
    If a random variable is not equivalent to the number of trials until the first
    success in independent trials with the same probability of success, the random
    variable does not have a geometric distribution.

<p>
    Suppose I toss a fair coin over and over until it lands heads.
    What is the chance I toss the coin fewer than 5 times?
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Solution</strong>. A box model for the experiment is to draw at random with
    replacement from a 0-1 box containing one ticket labeled &quot;1&quot; and one ticket
    labeled &quot;0&quot; until the first time the ticket labeled &quot;1&quot; is drawn.
    We seek the probability of drawing the ticket labeled &quot;1&quot; for
    the first time on the first, second, third, or fourth draw.
    In each draw, the chance of getting the ticket labeled &quot;1&quot; and
    the chance of getting the ticket labeled &quot;0&quot; are both 50%.
    The chance &quot;1&quot; is drawn on the first draw is 50%.
    The chance &quot;1&quot; is drawn for the first time on the second draw is 1/2 &times;1/2 = 25%.
    The chance &quot;1&quot; is drawn for the first time on the third draw is
    1/2 &times;1/2 &times;1/2 = 12.5%.
    The chance &quot;1&quot; is drawn for the first time on the fourth draw
    is 1/2 &times;1/2 &times;1/2 &times;1/2 = 6.25%.
    These events are mutually exclusive, so the chance &quot;1&quot; is drawn for the
    first time before the fifth draw (the chance of the union of the events)
    is the sum of their chances:
</p>

<p class="math">
    50% + 25% + 12.5% + 6.25% = 93.75%.
</p>

<p>
    That also must be the chance that I have to toss a fair coin fewer than five times
    before it lands heads.
    We could also find the probability more easily using the Complement Rule:
    The chance that it takes fewer than five tosses is 100% minus the
    chance that it takes at least five tosses.
    The chance that it takes at least five tosses is the chance that the first four
    tosses all yield tails, which is 1/2&times;1/2&times;1/2 &times;1/2  = 1/16 = 6.25%,
    because the tosses are independent.
    The chance that the first head occurs before the fifth toss is thus 100%&minus;6.25%=93.75%.

    Negative Binomial Distribution

<p>
    In random draws with replacement from a 0-1 box that contains a fraction
    <em>p</em>=<em>G</em>/<em>N</em> of tickets labeled &quot;1,&quot;
    the number of draws needed to get a ticket
    labeled &quot;1&quot; for the <em>r</em>th time has a negative binomial
    distribution with parameters <em>p</em> and <em>r</em>.
    (When <em>r</em>=1, the negative binomial distribution is the same as the
    geometric distribution&mdash;the distribution of the number of draws until a ticket
    labeled &quot;1&quot; is drawn for the first time.)
    Suppose X is a random variable with the negative binomial distribution
    with parameters <em>p</em> and <em>r</em>.
    What is P(X = <em>k</em>)&mdash;the chance that it takes <em>k</em> draws to get a ticket labeled
    &quot;1&quot; the <em>r</em>th time?
</p>

<p>
    Clearly, it takes at least <em>r</em> draws, so if <em>k</em> &lt; <em>r</em>, P(X = <em>k</em>) = 0.
    Consider, therefore, the chance for <em>k</em> &ge; <em>r</em>.
    How can the <em>k</em>th draw give a ticket labeled &quot;1&quot; for the <em>r</em>th time?
    The first <em>k</em>&minus;1 draws must give a ticket labeled &quot;1&quot; exactly <em>r</em>&minus;1
    times and a ticket labeled &quot;0&quot;
    (<em>k</em>&minus;1)&minus;(<em>r</em>&minus;1)&nbsp;=&nbsp;<em>k</em>&minus;<em>r</em> times, and the
    <em>k</em>th draw must give a ticket labeled &quot;1.&quot;
    We already know how to find the probability that <em>k</em>&minus;1 independent draws from a 0-1 box
    give a ticket labeled &quot;1&quot; <em>r</em>&minus;1 times:
    The number of tickets labeled &quot;1&quot; in <em>k</em>&minus;1 independent random draws with
    replacement from a 0-1 box
    has a binomial distribution with parameters <em>k</em>&minus;1 and <em>p</em>,
    so the chance of getting a ticket labeled &quot;1&quot;
    <em>r</em>&minus;1 times in <em>k</em>&minus;1 draws is
</p>

<p class="math">
    <sub><em>k</em>&minus;1</sub>C<sub><em>r</em>&minus;1</sub>&times;<em>p</em><sup><em>r</em>&minus;1</sup>
      &times; (1&minus;<em>p</em>)<sup>(<em>k</em>&minus;1)&minus;(<em>r</em>&minus;1)</sup> =
    <sub><em>k</em>&minus;1</sub>C<sub><em>r</em>&minus;1</sub>&times;<em>p</em><sup><em>r</em>&minus;1</sup>
      &times;(1&minus;<em>p</em>)<sup><em>k</em>&minus;<em>r</em></sup>.
</p>

<p>
    The chance that the <em>k</em>th draw gives a ticket labeled &quot;1&quot; is <em>p</em>,
    and because the draws are all independent, the chance that the
    first <em>k</em>&minus;1 draws give exactly <em>r</em>&minus;1 tickets labeled &quot;1&quot; and
    the <em>k</em>th draw also gives a ticket labeled &quot;1&quot; is the product
    of the probability that the first <em>k</em>&minus;1 draws give <em>r</em>&minus;1 tickets
    labeled &quot;1&quot; and the probability that the <em>k</em>th draw gives a
    ticket labeled &quot;1;&quot; namely,
</p>

<p class="math">
    <sub><em>k</em>&minus;1</sub>C<sub><em>r</em>&minus;1</sub> &times; <em>p</em><sup><em>r</em>&minus;1</sup>

</p>

<p>
    for <em>k</em> = <em>r</em>, <em>r</em> + 1, <em>r</em>
    + 2, &hellip; ; and 0 if <em>k</em> &lt; <em>r</em>.

<p>
    This is the <em>negative binomial probability distribution
    with parameters <em>p</em> and <em>r</em></em>.
</p>

<p>
    The essential requirement for a random variable to have the negative binomial
    distribution is that it count the number of trials to the <em>r</em>th success
    in independent trials with the same probability <em>p</em> of success
    in each trial.
    As described earlier in this chapter, if we identify success with drawing a
    ticket labeled &quot;1&quot; from a 0-1 box and identify failure with drawing a
    ticket labeled &quot;0&quot; from the box, each draw can be thought of as a trial
    that results in success or failure.
    If we draw at random with replacement, the trials are independent and
    have the same probability <em>p</em> of success&mdash;the proportion of tickets labeled
    &quot;1&quot; does not change from draw to draw.
    If a random variable is not equivalent to the number of trials it takes to
    get the <em>r</em>th success in independent trials with the same probability <em>p</em>
    of success in each trial, it does not have a negative binomial distribution.

    I shall toss a fair coin repeatedly (and independently) until the coin lands heads
    the sixth time.
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        What is the chance that it takes exactly ten tosses?
    </li>
    <li>
        What is the chance that it takes more than 7 tosses?
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    <strong>Solution</strong>.
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        <p>The number of tosses it takes to get six heads is the number of trials to
        the sixth success in independent trials each of which has probability
        <em>p</em>=50% of success.
        It therefore has the negative binomial distribution with parameters
        <em>p</em> = 50% and <em>r</em> = 6, so the chance that it takes exactly 10 tosses is:
        </p>
        <p class="math">
            <sub>9</sub>C<sub>5</sub> &times; 0.5<sup>6</sup> &times; (1&minus;0.5)<sup>4</sup>
            = 126 &times; 0.5<sup>10</sup> = 12.30%.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Notice that it takes at least 6 tosses to get heads for the sixth time;
        applying the Complement Rule,
        we see that the chance we seek is:
        </p>
        <p class="math">
            100%&minus;(chance it takes 7 or fewer tosses) = 100% &minus; (chance it takes 6

    The Hypergeometric Distribution
</h3>

</p>
<p>
    The sample sum of the labels on the tickets in a random sample without replacement
    from a 0-1 box has the <em>hypergeometric distribution</em>.
    A <em>random sample without replacement of size <em>n</em> from a population of
    <em>N</em> units</em>,
    also called <em>a simple random sample of size <em>n</em> from a population of
    <em>N</em> units</em>,
    is a sample drawn in such a way that every subset of <em>n</em> of the
    <em>N</em> units in the population is equally likely to be the sample.
    Equivalently, the sample has a uniform distribution on the
    <sub><em>N</em></sub>C<sub><em>n</em></sub> subsets of <em>n</em>
    of the <em>N</em> tickets.
    One can think of a simple random sample as being drawn in <em>n</em> steps:
    A unit is drawn at random from all <em>N</em> units in the population, then
    a unit is drawn at random from the remaining <em>N</em>&minus;1 units, and so on.
    In the last step, a unit is drawn at random from the remaining <em>N</em>&minus;<em>n</em>+1 units.
    In each step, the draw is equally likely to yield each remaining unit.
</p>

<p>
    Consider drawing a simple random sample of size <em>n</em> from a 0-1 box of <em>N</em> tickets
    of which <em>G</em> are labeled &quot;1&quot; and the other <em>N</em>&minus;<em>G</em>
    are labeled &quot;0.&quot;
    What is the chance that the sample sum of the labels on the
    tickets in the sample will equal <em>k</em>?
    Equivalently, what is the chance that exactly <em>k</em> of the <em>n</em> tickets in
    the sample will be labeled &quot;1&quot; (and the remaining <em>n</em>&minus;<em>k</em>
    will be labeled &quot;0&quot;)?
</p>

<p>
    We can solve this problem using the
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#fundamental_rule_of_counting">Fundamental Rule of Counting</a>,
    and what we know about combinations.
    Let X be the (random) number of tickets labeled &quot;1&quot; in the
    simple random sample of size <em>n</em>.
    Clearly, X cannot exceed the smaller of <em>n</em> and <em>G</em>
    (there cannot be more tickets labeled &quot;1&quot; in the sample than
    there are tickets in the sample, and there cannot be more tickets
    labeled &quot;1&quot; in the sample than there are in the box, because the
    sample is drawn without replacement).
    Furthermore, X must be at least the larger of zero and
    <em>n</em>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;(<em>N</em>&minus;<em>G</em>):
    We cannot get a negative number of tickets labeled &quot;1,&quot; and there
    are only <em>N</em>&minus;<em>G</em> tickets labeled &quot;0&quot; in the population, so if the sample
    is larger than <em>N</em>&minus;<em>G</em>, it must contain some of the tickets labeled &quot;1.&quot;
</p>

<p>
    Subject to these restrictions, how can the sample contain <em>k</em> tickets
    labeled &quot;1?&quot;
    We can think of drawing such a sample as a sequence
    of two experiments: drawing <em>k</em> tickets labeled &quot;1&quot; from the population
    of <em>G</em> tickets labeled &quot;1,&quot; then drawing <em>n</em>&minus;<em>k</em> tickets
    labeled &quot;0&quot; from the
    population of <em>N</em>&minus;<em>G</em> tickets labeled &quot;0,&quot;
    resulting in a subset of size <em>n</em>
    from the population of size <em>N</em>.
    By the Fundamental Rule of Counting, there are
</p>

<p class="math">
    <sub><em>G</em></sub>C<sub><em>k</em></sub> &times;
    <sub><em>N</em>&minus;<em>G</em></sub>C<sub><em>n</em>&minus;<em>k</em></sub>
</p>

<p>
    ways of doing this (recall that <sub><em>G</em></sub>C<sub><em>k</em></sub>
    is the number of <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#combination">combinations</a>
    of <em>k</em> of a set of <em>G</em> things).
    The total number of possible outcomes of drawing <em>n</em> tickets without
    replacement is the number of subsets of size <em>n</em> one can form from
    the population of <em>N</em> tickets, which is <sub><em>N</em></sub>C<sub><em>n</em></sub>.
    By assumption, our method of drawing samples makes each of these equally likely.
    The chance that the simple random sample contains exactly <em>k</em> tickets
    labeled &quot;1&quot; is thus

    for max(0, <em>n</em> &minus; (<em>N</em>&minus;<em>G</em>)) &le;
    <em>k</em> &le; min(<em>n</em>, <em>G</em>). (In case the notation is unfamiliar,
    max(<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>) is the larger of <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>;
    min(<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>) is the
    smaller of <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>.)
    The chance is 0 if <em>k</em> is outside that range
    of possibilities.
</p>

<p>
    This is the <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#hypergeometric_distrib">hypergeometric
    probability distribution</a> with parameters <em>N</em>, <em>G</em>, and <em>n</em>: It
    gives for each <em>k</em> the chance that the sample sum of the labels on the tickets
    equals <em>k</em>, for a simple random sample (a random sample without replacement) of
    size <em>n</em> from a box of <em>N</em> tickets of which <em>G</em> are labeled
    &quot;1&quot; and the rest are labeled &quot;0.&quot;
</p>

<p>
    Sometimes it is convenient to think of the draws as being from
    a population of <em>N</em> objects of which <em>G</em> are &quot;good&quot; and
    <em>N</em>&minus;<em>G</em> are &quot;bad.&quot;
    The number of good objects in a simple random sample of size <em>n</em> from such a
    population has the hypergeometric probability distribution with parameters
    <em>N</em>, <em>G</em>, and <em>n</em>.

    is a calculator to find the chance that a random variable with a binomial,
    geometric, negative binomial, or hypergeometric distribution falls in any range.
    It also gives the expected value and standard error of these distributions,
    which we shall study in the next few chapters.
    To use the tool, select the distribution you want from the drop-down menu.
    The display then prompts for the parameters of the
    distribution, and for the range of values of which to find the probability.
</p>

<p>
    The parameters are labeled slightly differently from the notation we have used so far:
</p>

<p>
    For the binomial distribution:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>&quot;Trials&quot; is the number <em>n</em> of draws from the box.</li>
    <li>&quot;P(success)&quot; is the fraction <em>p</em> of tickets in the box
        labeled &quot;1.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>
    For the geometric distribution:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>&quot;P(success)&quot; is the fraction <em>p</em> of tickets in the box
       labeled &quot;1.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>
    For the negative binomial distribution:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>&quot;P(success)&quot; is the fraction <em>p</em> of tickets labeled &quot;1&quot;
        in the box.</li>
    <li>&quot;#successes&quot; is the number <em>r</em> of tickets labeled &quot;1&quot;
        to draw before stopping.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    For the hypergeometric distribution:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>&quot;Population size&quot; is the number <em>N</em> of tickets in the box.<./li>
    <li>&quot;Good in population&quot; is the number <em>G</em> of tickets
        labeled &quot;1&quot; in the box.</li>
</ul>

    Seventeen tickets will be drawn at random without replacement from a 0-1
    box containing 50 tickets of which 20 are labeled &quot;1.&quot;
    What is the probability that the number of tickets labeled &quot;1&quot; in the sample
    is between 5 and 15, inclusive?
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Solution</strong>. The number of tickets labeled &quot;1&quot; in the sample
    is the sample sum of a simple random sample of size <em>n</em>=17 from a 0-1 box
    containing <em>N</em>=50 tickets of which <em>G</em>=20 are labeled &quot;1,&quot; so that it has
    an hypergeometric distribution with parameters <em>N</em>=50, <em>G</em>=20, and <em>n</em>=17.
    To find the probability, in
<script language="JavaScript1.4" type="text/javascript"><!--
    citeFig(figCtr-1);
// -->
</script>
    select &quot;Hypergeometric&quot; in the top drop-down menu.
    Set Population Size to 50,  #Good in Population to 20, and Sample Size to 17.
    Tic the box that precedes X&ge;, type 5 into the box that follows X&ge;,
    tic the box that precedes X&le;, and type 15 into the box that follows
    X&le;.
    The figure should show that the probability sought is 92.094%

    Toss a fair coin twice and roll a fair die twice, all independently.
    Let X be the sum of the number of heads in the two tosses and the number
    of times the die shows one spot in the two rolls.
    Even though the random variable X counts
    &quot;successes&quot; in a fixed number (four) of independent trials,
    it does not have a binomial probability distribution, because the
    probability of success is not the same in every trial: It is 1/2 in the
    trials that involve the coin, and 1/6 in the trials that involve the die.
    Let us find the probability distribution of X.
</p>

<p>
    The possible values of X are 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    What is the chance that X = 0?
    For that to occur, the two die rolls need to show something other than ones,
    and the coin needs to land tails-up on both tosses.
    Because all the tosses and rolls are independent, the chance of this is
</p>

<p class="math">
    P(no &quot;ones&quot; and no &quot;heads&quot;) =
    <sub>2</sub>C<sub>0</sub> &times; (1/6)<sup>0</sup> &times;
    (5/6)<sup>2</sup> &times; <sub>2</sub>C<sub>0</sub> &times;
    (1/2)<sup>0</sup> &times; (1/2)<sup>2</sup>
      = 25/144.
</p>

<p>
    What is the chance that X = 1?
    For that to occur, either exactly one die roll needs to give a one
    and the coin needs to land tails both times, or exactly one coin toss
    needs to give a head and the die rolls need to give something
    other than a one both times.
    These events are mutually exclusive, so we can find the chance of
    their union by adding their chances.
    Each of these events has two binomial components: the number of times a
    one is rolled in the two die rolls, and the number of times the coin
    lands &quot;heads&quot; in two tosses.
    Because the rolls and tosses are independent, we can find the chance
    that &quot;one&quot; is rolled a specific number of times and the coin lands
    &quot;heads&quot; a certain number of times by multiplying the chances of the
    number of ones and the number of heads.
    We have

</p>
<p>

    This example is based on a true story.
    The names of the people and firms have been changed, but otherwise,
    the facts are stated as I understand them.
    The data were presented previously in 
<script language="JavaScript1.4" type="text/javascript"><!--

</p>

<p>
    On 1 May 1995, Sue Mi and Leigh Teagate, two former employees of WeeBee Hardware (WBH),
    a firm that sells computer components to computer assemblers and retailers,
    opened the doors of a new company, Weasel Drives (WD).
    Sue Mi had worked at WBH up to the day before WD opened its doors;
    Leigh Teagate had stopped working for WBH about 18 months previously.
    Both firms are in the greater San Francisco Bay Area.
    From the time WD started business, it sold essentially the same kinds of
    computer components that WBH did, mostly to former customers of Sue Mi,
    at essentially the same prices and with essentially the same credit terms.
    Indeed, in the first two days WD was in business, Sue Mi called the top dozen
    of her former accounts at WBH.
    In its first month of business, WD sold about $1 million of equipment to former
    customers of WBH; that amount increased to about $2&nbsp;million/month in the
    course of a few months.
</p>

<p>
    The principals of WBH sought an injunction against WD to prevent it from selling
    to customers of WBH, alleging that their customer list was a trade secret and
    had been misappropriated by Sue Mi and Leigh Teagate.
    (A further complication is that another former employee of WBH and
    archrival of the principals of WBH apparently set up WD's business,
    including renting facilities for them, financing their startup, and advancing
    about $400,000 of inventory to them without collateral.)
</p>

<p>
    It is well established that a customer list can qualify as a trade secret:
    It has economic value, and derives its value from not being known generally.
    Customer lists can be the product of years of soliciting new business by
    cold-calling tens of thousands of potential customers and winnowing
    that list down to a few hundred or a few thousand who actually do buy the
    kind of equipment the firm sells, who will buy it from that firm, and
    who pay promptly (or at least reliably).
    With knowledge of a firm's list of customers, a competitor would not need to
    make cold calls to find potential customers, check credit references, or
    establish a credit history with a particular customer to learn whether it
    was creditworthy.
</p>

<p>
    WD asserted in response to WBH's request for an injunction that (1) they found
    the names of the customers in public sources, such as CD-ROMs that contain
    lists of businesses, and from computer magazines in which those customers
    advertise, not from their knowledge of WBH's customers, and that (2) such
    a large overlap with WBH's customer list was inevitable, because WBH had
    so many customers.
</p>

<p>
    A California Court of Appeals decision (<em>ABBA Rubber Co. v. Seaquist 286 Cal.
    Rptr. at 528</em>) establishes that a &quot;readily ascertainable by proper
    means&quot; affirmative defense to a claim of misappropriation is appropriate
    under certain circumstances:
</p>

<blockquote>
    [I]f the defendants can convince the finder of fact &hellip;
    (1) that &quot;It is a virtual certainty that anyone who manufactures certain types of
    products uses rubber rollers, (2) that the manufacturers of those products are
    easily identifiable, and (3) that the defendants' knowledge of the plaintiff's
    customers resulted from that identification process and not from the
    plaintiff's records, then the defendants may establish a defense to
    the misappropriation claim.&quot;
</blockquote>
<p>
     <em>ABBA Rubber Co., 286 Cal. Rptr. at 529, ftnt. 9.</em>
</p>

<p>
    WD thus would be in the clear if they could show that they identified the
    customers they called from the CD-ROMs and/or magazines without using
    their knowledge of WBHs customer list.
    I was retained to calculate the probability that various subsets of
    WD's customer list would overlap with analogous subsets of WBH's customer
    list to the extent that they do, under various assumptions.

<p>
    The CD-ROMs and magazine advertisements contain information that would allow one to
    determine whether a firm is a potential purchaser of the kinds of equipment both
    WBH and WD sell, but no additional information that would identify one of the
    potential purchasers as a better sales prospect than any other.
    To test the claim of &quot;inevitability,&quot; we might just look at the chance that
    the overlap would be so large if WD used simple random sampling to select from
    the CD-ROMS and ads a smaller number of such potential customers to contact.
    This is not to suggest that WD did use or should have used simple random sampling;
    at issue is the inevitability of the overlap.
</p>

<p>
    Consider the customers WD claimed to have found in magazines.
    There were 469 advertisers of computer components in the magazines identified in the
    discovery process, 27 of which were contacted by WD in the first months of business.
    Suppose WD had selected 27 firms to contact at random without replacement from the 469.
    The sample would be equally likely to be any subset of 27 of the 469 firms.
    (There are <sub>469</sub>C<sub>27</sub> such subsets.
    The subsequent analysis assumes that WD contacted 27 customers from among the
    magazine advertisers&mdash;the number 27 is taken to be fixed, not random.)
</p>

<p>
    Of the 27 firms whose names WD claim to have identified from the computer magazines,
    26 were customers of WBH.
    Of the 469 computer advertisers in the magazines, 152 were customers of WBH.
    What is the chance that a simple random sample of 27 firms from 469, of which
    152 are customers of WBH, would contain 26 or more WBH customers?
</p>

<p>
    This is the same as the chance that a random sample of 27 tickets drawn with
    replacement from a 0-1 box of 469 tickets, of which 152 are labeled &quot;1&quot; and
    the remaining (469&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;152) = 317 are labeled &quot;0,&quot; would contain
    26 or 27 tickets labeled &quot;1&quot;.
    The probability is given by the
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#hypergeometric">hypergeometric distribution</a>:
</p>

<p class="math">
    P(overlap is 26 or more) = P(overlap is 26 or 27)
</p>

<p class="math">
    = P(overlap is 26) + P(overlap is 27)
</p>

<p class="math">
        = (<sub>152</sub>C<sub>26</sub> &times;
        <sub>469&minus;152</sub>C<sub>1</sub>)/<sub>469</sub>C<sub>27</sub> +
        (<sub>152</sub>C<sub>27</sub> &times;
        <sub>469&minus;152</sub>C<sub>0</sub>)/<sub>469</sub>C<sub>27</sub>

</p>

        = 0.0000000000778%.
</p>

<p>
    There are 10 zeros between the decimal point and the first &quot;7.&quot;
    This is comparable to the chance of winning the grand prize in California Lotto two weeks
    in a row.
    The hypergeometric distribution also can be used to calculate the probability that if WD
    had selected 31 firms from the CD-ROM at random, the 31 firms would contain as many of
    WBH's customers as it did, or even more.
    The CD-ROMs contain the names, phone numbers, and addresses of at least 90,000 firms
    that would be potential purchasers of the kind of equipment WD and WBH both sell.
    We shall assume that all 3310 of WBH's active customers are among the 90,000+
    on the CD-ROM.
    There were 22 WBH customers among the 31 firms whose names WD claimed to
    have gotten from the CD-ROM.
    The chance that a randomly selected set of 31 firms from the CD-ROM would contain 22 or
    more of WBH's 3310 active customers is:

    We can also look at the overall overlap of the two firms' customer lists,
    without regard to the source from which WD claimed to have gotten the names
    of their customers.
    In the United States, there are more than 90,000 firms that are potential purchasers of
    the kind of equipment WBH and WD sell.
    Of those, 3310 were active customers of WBH, and 132 are active customers of WD;
    they have 93 customers in common.
    If WD's 132 customers had been selected randomly from the 90,000+, the chance
    their list would overlap with WBH's by 93 or more also would be given by the
    hypergeometric distribution:
</p>

<p class="math">
    P(overlap is 93 or more) = P(overlap is 93) + P(overlap is 94) + &hellip;
    + P(overlap is 132)

    (There are 99 zeros between the decimal point and the &quot;1.&quot;
    The inequality sign is because there are at least 90,000 US computer firms who
    potentially buy the kind of equipment WD and WBH sell.)
    This is less than the chance of winning the grand prize in California Lotto 13 weeks in a row.
</p>

<p>
    We can also look at whether WD selectively pursued WBH customers when they sought
    business outside the San Francisco Bay Area.
    There are at least 60,000 firms outside the Bay Area that potentially buy equipment
    of the kind sold by WD and WBH. 1769 of these are customers of WBH; 8 are customers of WD;
    all 8 of WD's customers are also customers of WBH.
    If WD had selected 8 customers at random from the 60,000 or more outside the Bay Area,
    the chance that all 8 would have been customers of WBH as well would be
</p>

<p class="math">
    P(overlap is 8) = (<sub>1769</sub>C<sub>8</sub> &times;

<p>
    There are 10 zeros between the decimal point and the &quot;5.&quot;
    WD's telephone billing records were also obtained in discovery.
    Local calls do not result in specific telephone billing records, so it is not
    possible to determine the fraction of WD's local calls to customers of WBH.
    However, long distance and local toll calls&mdash;calls beyond a certain
    radius from WD&mdash;do result in records that can be analyzed.
    We shall denote such a call a &quot;recorded&quot; call.
    In May, 1995, WD placed 1050 recorded calls to a total of 68 firms,
    of which 53 were customers of WBH.
    1006 of the 1050 recorded calls were to WBH customers.
    Let us assume, for the moment, that WD derived their list of 132 customers
    legitimately.
    If WD were not specifically targeting customers of WBH, one would expect
    that the fraction of WD's calls to customers of WBH would be approximately
    in proportion to the fraction of WD's customers who are also WBH's customers.
    I.e., one would expect about 93/132 of WD's calls to be to WBH customers, and
    about 39/132 of their calls to be to non-WBH customers.
    A plausible model for phone calls, if WD were not specifically targeting
    WBH's customers, would be that each of WD's recorded calls is placed to a WBH
    customer with probability 93/132, and to a non-WBH customer with probability
    39/132, and that whether a call is to a WBH or non-WBH customer is independent
    from call to call. In that case (and given that WD placed 1050 recorded calls
    in all), the number of recorded calls by WD to WBH customers would have a
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#binomial">binomial distribution</a>
    with parameters <em>n</em> = 1050 and <em>p</em> = 93/132. Then
</p>

<p class="math">
    P(1006 or more of 1050 recorded calls are to WBH customers | list of 132
    customers overlaps by 93) = P(1006 calls to WBH customers | overlap) +
    P(1007 calls to WBH customers | overlap) +  &nbsp;&hellip;  +
    P(1050 calls to WBH customers | overlap)

</p>

<p>
    There are 97 zeros between the decimal point and the &quot;7.&quot;
    This too is less than the chance of winning Lotto 13 weeks in a row.
    And it assumes that the list of 132 customers was derived legitimately.
</p>

<p>
    A different assumption that also seems reasonable is that the recorded calls to
    WBH customers would be in proportion to the fraction of WBH customers among
    those of WD to whom calls would be recorded: 53/68.
    This would change the answer somewhat:
    We might then model the number of recorded calls by WD to WBH customers using a
    binomial distribution with parameters <em>n</em> = 1050 and <em>p</em> = 53/68,
    which would give
</p>

<p class="math">
    <sub>1050</sub>C<sub>1006</sub> &times; (53/68)<sup>1006</sup> &times; (15/68)<sup>44</sup> +
    <sub>1050</sub>C<sub>1007</sub> &times; (53/68)<sup>1007</sup> &times; (15/68)<sup>43</sup> +

</p>

<p>
    which is also rather small.
</p>

<p>
    We can use the Multiplication Rule to combine this with the chance that the lists
    overlap to the extent they do, to find the unconditional chance that WD would
    make so many of its recorded calls to WBH customers, had it selected its customers
    at random and placed phone calls independently with equal chance of calling
    each of its customers. To make this calculation, we assume that there are at
    least 60,000 potential customers to whom calls by WD would result in phone records,
    and we use the fact that calls by WD to 2906 of WBH's customers would have
    resulted in phone records.
    In that case, under the assumptions already stated, with &quot;customers&quot;
    taken to mean &quot;customers to whom calls by WD would result in phone records,&quot;

    Although it is doubtful that anyone would choose customers to call randomly, and although

    clearly refute the defendants' claim that the large overlap of their customer

    A <em>random variable</em> is an assignment of
    numbers to outcomes of a random experiment.
    If a random variable has a <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#countable">countable</a>
    number of possible values, it is <em>discrete</em>.
    The <em>probability distribution</em> of a random variable says, for each possible value of
    the random variable, what the chance is that the random variable will equal that value.
    Probability distributions can be given by formulae or tables.
    If a probability distribution assigns probability 100% to the
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#union">union</a>
    of a countable set of outcomes, the probability distribution is said to be <em>discrete</em>.
    Probability distributions of discrete random variables are discrete.

    Consider a box of <em>N</em> tickets of which <em>G</em> are labeled &quot;1&quot; and
    <em>N</em>&minus;<em>G</em> are labeled &quot;0.&quot;
    The sample sum of the labels on <em>n</em> tickets drawn at random with replacement
    from the box has a <em>binomial distribution</em> with parameters <em>n</em> and

    The number of tickets that must be drawn with replacement until the first

    The number of tickets that must be drawn with replacement until the <em>r</em>th time a
    ticket labeled &quot;1&quot; is drawn has a <em>negative binomial distribution</em>
