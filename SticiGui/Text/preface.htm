       introductory class in Statistics suitable students in Business, Communications, 
       Economics, Psychology, 
       Social Science, or liberal arts;
       that is, this is the first and last class in Statistics for most students who take it.
       It also covers logic and reasoning at a level suitable for a general education course.
       Accordingly, the text is not geared toward theory, numerical analysis, or
       sophisticated
       formulae; neither does it contain a bestiary of techniques or named probability
       distributions.
       Rather, I hope to help students to think logically about quantitative evidence
       and to translate real-world situations into mathematical questions; and to
       expose students to a few important statistical and probabilistic concepts and
       to some of the difficulties, subjective decisions, and pitfalls, in analyzing
       data and making inferences from numbers.
       The text develops probability, estimation, and inference using
       counting arguments: there is no calculus involved.
</p>
</div>

<p>
    I hope that students who study from these materials will:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Read the newspaper with new eyes: become skilled, circumspect
        consumers of qualitative and quantitative information.
    </li>
    <li>
        Know that probability in particular, and numbers in general,
        can be used to model some features of the physical world and human behavior.
    </li>
    <li>
        Improve their skills in critical thinking and logical reasoning.
    </li>
    <li>
        Appreciate the role Statistics plays in many fields, from
        business to economics, law, politics, science and medicine.
    </li>
    <li>
        Know that data can be manipulated to tell many inconsistent stories,
        that data analysis is not clear cut, and that many subjective
        judgments are involved in analyzing real data.
    </li>
    <li>
        Know important questions to ask when faced with a quantitative argument&mdash;be
        able to analyze arguments and find their strengths and weaknesses.
    </li>
    <li>
        Understand that untutored intuition tends to produce faulty probability
        judgments and know how to reason about probability.
    </li>
    <li>
        Appreciate some of the philosophical difficulties in ascribing meaning
        to probability and in inferring causal relationships from data.
    </li>
    <li>
    	Be prepared for more advanced courses in Statistics&mdash;even though
    	they might not take any.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    The text starts with reasoning and fallacies, which is perhaps a bit unusual for a Statistics
    textbook&mdash;but logical reasoning is key to both theoretical and empirical work.
    The text goes further with counting arguments and combinatorics than most
    elementary textbooks do; it also goes further with logic and with data analysis.
    The applets incorporated into the materials enable students to analyze
    real datasets (the largest has 913
    observations of 5 variables) without the pedagogical overhead of
    teaching students to use a proprietary statistics package.
    Students also reproduce numerical
    experiments that demonstrate key concepts, such as sampling distributions,
    confidence intervals, and the Law of Large Numbers.
    Using applets also
    eliminates the need to teach students to read arcane tables associated with
    different distributions; instead, students type the relevant parameters into
    textboxes, highlight a range of values, and read off the probability.
</p>

<p>
    I have tried
    to emphasize topics that can be taught most effectively with this sort of
    interactive online tool. I have sought to provide enough variety in the material
    that instructors can pick and choose from among the chapters to find material
    appropriate to the level at which they desire to teach.  The most technical
    material is in footnotes and sidebars, so that it does not interrupt the flow.
    Many of the examples and datasets for exercises are real&mdash;they arose in my
    consulting work, in experiments I am familiar with, or they are in the public
    domain (for example, data on GMAT scores, undergraduate GPA, and MBA GPA).
</p>

<p>
    Many of the inference problems are real, too.
    For example, the Kassel Dowsing
    Experiment is a real test of the ability of dowsers to determine whether water is
    running in a buried pipe; the derivation of Fisher's exact test is in the context
    of determining whether targeted Web advertising works, a problem I have studied
    for a consulting client; the case studies about employment discrimination and
    theft of trade secrets derive from my work as an expert witness.
</p>

<p>
    I have tried to
    motivate many of the computations by inference problems.
    Probability, hypothesis
    testing, randomization, and sampling error, are woven into the discussion of
    experiments and sample surveys.
    For some introductory courses, the probability in
    those sections will suffice.
    For instructors who desire a more quantitative text,
    there are additional chapters on probability distributions, discrete random
    variables, and expectation.
</p>

<p>
    The book does not discuss continuous distributions:
    The normal curve, Student's t-curve, and the chi-square curve appear as
    approximations to the probability histograms of discrete random variables, not as
    probability densities of continuous random variables.
    These curves are motivated
    by interactive experiments using applets that show empirically that the sampling
    distributions of some random variables converge to the curves.
    Probability is
    developed by counting; inference is developed using counting and sampling
    experiments that illustrate regularities.
</p>

<p>
    Above all else, I strive to be
    correct and not silly&mdash;I generally avoid presenting techniques I would
    not use as a consultant or expert witness.
    There are exceptions, but I have tried to mark
    them clearly.
    For example, I find little use for the t-test or Student t
    confidence intervals for the mean, but as a concession to their popularity,
    I have included them&mdash;isolated in a single chapter that I
    usually do not cover.
    (But I present conservative confidence intervals for population percentages based on
    Chebychev's inequality, confidence intervals for percentiles, and Fisher's exact test.)
    ANOVA is missing for that reason.
    So is any use of regression as an inferential tool rather than a descriptive tool.
    Such uses are generally shaky, if not misleading or simply wrong.
</p>

<p>
	These materials have been used to teach large undergraduate courses at
	UC Berkeley since 1997.
	They are the basis of the first fully online course offered
	by UC Berkeley, Statistics N21, Summer 2007.
        They have been used at other schools, including Bard College, City University of New York,
        John Jay College of Criminal Justice, 
        University of California Santa Cruz, San Jose State University,
        and Laney College.
</p>

<h3>
   <a id="overview"></a>Overview of the Online Textbook
</h3>

<p>
    If you are reading this in print, rather than in a Web browser,
    the following does
    not apply to the version you are reading.
    The online version of the materials has
    much more functionality than any print book can have:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        It is interactive: Students perform numerical experiments,
        analyze data, and manipulate plots to learn fundamental statistical
        and probabilistic concepts.
        The text combines guided exploration with the presentation of new
        material.
        The format encourages students to practice and to ask themselves and
        answer &quot;what if?&quot; questions&mdash;to learn through inquiry.
        The practice exercises are graded instantly, and detailed solutions
        are a click away.
    </li>
    <li>
        It is dynamic: Many examples and exercises change every time a page
        is reloaded, providing a practically unlimited number of practice
        problems.
    </li>
    <li>
        It is individual: Each student can work at his own pace, and can
        emphasize those subjects he finds most challenging or most
        interesting by reloading the chapter.
        If the instructor desires, every student can be administered a
        different version of the end of chapter quizzes.
    </li>
    <li>
        It is efficient and convenient: Quizzes are graded automatically and
        logged in on online database.
        Each student can see the solution to his individual version of the
        quizzes after the due date.
    </li>
    <li>
        It is easy for students to use: The text is accessible through standard
        web browsers.
        There is none of the start-up cost associated with learning to use
        a proprietary statistical software package.
    </li>
    <li>
        It is easy for instructors to use: Assignment due dates and
        enrollment lists are controlled over the Web using a browser.
        Instructors do not have to write quizzes, collect quizzes,
        record quiz grades, or return quizzes to students.
        Moreover, instructors do not have to teach students to use
        specialized software.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    The software empowers students to reproduce numerical experiments
    themselves, without having to learn a statistical language
    (using instead a standard Web browser), which encourages exploration
    and inquiry-based learning.
    The text uses the power of the Internet in many ways, including the following:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Links to a <a href="gloss.htm" target="glossWin">glossary of terms</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Dynamic examples and self-test exercises that change every time a
        student visits a chapter.
        Some self-test exercises parse student input to determine whether
        student formulae are correct&mdash;a much more sophisticated notion of
        correctness than multiple choice or numerical responses.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="../Problems/index.htm">online, machine-graded assignments</a>
        (using forms and applets),
        constructed so that each student gets a different version of the assignment.
        Grades are
        posted automatically to the class website, and solutions are available
        online after the due date.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="../Review/index.htm">Reference and practice materials</a>
        to prepare for exams.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>
    <a id="prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites
</h3>

<p>
    These materials do not assume that the reader has any previous
    knowledge of statistics or probability. However, the reader needs
    to be comfortable with percentages, exponentiation and square roots, and
    &quot;scientific notation&quot; (numbers times powers of ten).
    Assignment 0 is a review and quiz covering the prerequisite material.
    The ultimate calculations are all simple, but the logical reasoning
    needed to reduce the problems to those simple calculations are sometimes
    subtle.
</p>

<p>
    Some of the footnotes and sidebars rely on elementary calculus to find
    stationary points of convex, continuously differentiable functions.
    For example, the mean is characterized as the number from which the
    rms of the residuals is smallest, and the regression line is characterized
    as the least-squares line.
    Those derivations can be skipped with impunity.
</p>

<h3>
    <a id="design"></a>
    Technical Design Criteria and Implementation
</h3>

<p>
    These materials are comprised of XHTML, CSS, Java, and JavaScript.
    As of 19 June 2011, they consisted of
    217 XHTML files containing over 136,000
    lines of XHTML and JavaScript,
    63 Java classes containing about 16,000 lines of code,
    27 JavaScript libraries containing about 14,900 lines of code,
    34 data files containing about 5,600 records,
    four cascading style sheets with about 2,200 lines,
    and a handful of .jpg and .gif files.
    The choice to use XHTML, CSS, Java and JavaScript was motivated by these design criteria:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Maximize accessibility and portability.
    Recent browsers allow this material to be
    accessed from almost anywhere in the world, without adding &quot;plug-ins&quot; to the
    browser, and without buying any proprietary software.
    If a &quot;plug-in&quot; were required, downloading the
    plug-in would itself present a considerable barrier to some students.
    The software runs under every major
    operating system (unix, linux, Windows 9x and NT, Mac OS), because Mozilla, Opera and/or
    Microsoft have versions of their browsers that run on those operating systems.
    Browsers come installed on all new personal computers, so this material is
    immediately accessible to new computer owners. (Installing Java might be necessary.)
    I have made a considerable effort to make the materials function well with screen reader
    software for visually impaired students&mdash;but there is more work to be done.
    (MathML seems to be the solution to the remaining problems, but as of this writing, only
    Firefox can render MathML directly.)
  </li>
  <li>
    Maximize interactivity and minimize technological barriers.
    Students should be
    able to explore data and to ask and answer &quot;what-if&quot; questions, without needing
    to learn how to use a conventional statistical software package.
    Tools should have a point-and-click interface whose use was fairly obvious --
    no hidden menus, consistent GUI, <em>etc</em>.).
  </li>
  <li>
    Minimize bandwidth and maximize speed. Using Java allows the figures and plots to be
    generated on the client-side. The code and data download to the client, then the client
    computes and creates the figures. This is by far the most efficient way to get dynamic
    interaction with the data.
    Otherwise, every time the user changed a parameter value, the
    client would need to send a message to the server, and the server would have to compute
    the new figure, and send the resulting figure over the Internet to the client.
    Interactive real-time data exploration would not be possible.
    There are a small number of figures that are stored as GIF or JPG files;
    almost all the figures are computed by the client.
    Sending just the data and the rules (programs) for generating
    figures from the data substantially reduces the time it takes pages to load.
    Many of the figures are pure CSS, which not only is very lightweight, but allows
    the figures to re-size elegantly if the user changes
    the dimensions of the page, and displays well even on mobile devices.
  </li>
  <li>
    Make it easy to use the materials in lectures.
    Because the software is free-standing (it
    does not need a server for computations), it is easy to display the content in the
    classroom without an Internet connection.
    That allows the instructor to demonstrate
    concepts and the use of the materials in class.
  </li>
  <li>
    Make it easy for instructors to set due dates for assignments and manage a course, and
    for students to track their own progress. Due dates are controlled by the instructor over
    the Internet; similarly, the instructor can modify grades, compute course scores, enter
    extra credit assignments, <em>etc</em>., using a browser. Perl-cgi routines update the
    database when a student submits an assignment, and allow students and instructors to query
    the database for grades over the Internet.
    As an alternative to perl cgi, assignment due
    dates can be controlled by modifying a simple ascii text file that is queried by a Java
    applet, and assignment grades can be redirected to an email address instead of a database.
  </li>
  <li>
    Maximize portability on the server side.
    Rather than use proprietary solutions, such as
    Microsoft active server pages (.asp pages) or server-side JavaScript, the &quot;back
    end&quot; is a collection of perl cgi routines that access a standard
    database file.
    The server only needs to support perl scripts and serve static XHTML, JavaScript, text, CSS and
    Java class files.
    This makes the package
    platform-independent on the server side as well as the client side: there is public-domain
    software allowing perl cgi to run with every common web server, and there are
    public-domain perl implementations for all popular operating systems.
    Installing the materials on a new server is simple.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
    Using XHTML with Java, JavaScript and CSS allowed me to make the content dynamic: many of the
    examples and exercises in the text change whenever the page is reloaded, so students can
    get unlimited practice at certain kinds of problems. Similarly, each student gets a
    different version of each assignment and exam, but can see the solutions to his/her
    version after the due date.
</p>

<h3>
    <a id="javaAdvantages"></a>Advantages of Java over standard
    Statistical Packages
</h3>

<p>
    There are a number of advantages to using Java applets rather than an integrated
    statistical package:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    The material can be accessed from any computer with an Internet
    connection and a web browser.
    The computer does not need to have any proprietary software installed.
    Students therefore can access the material from university and public
    libraries, Internet cafes, home, <em>etc</em>.
    Students have even submitted homework using WebTV.
  </li>
  <li>
    Some of the demonstrations would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to code in a
    standard statistical package.
    For example, see the Venn Diagram applet.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a standard package were used, the figures/demonstrations/calculations could not be
    embedded in the text and the assignments. The student would have to navigate among
    programs to see demonstrations or solve problems.
  </li>
  <li>
    The intellectual start-up cost to the student is lower than it would be for a
    general-purpose package.
    Each tool illustrates a single concept, all the controls
    are visible, and the interface is as intuitive as I have been able to make it.
    The student does not need to learn much to get started.
  </li>
  <li>
    I find it preferable pedagogically to use tools with a single function, with all the
    controls visible.
  </li>
  <li>
    The monetary cost to the student is minimized.
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>
    <a id="evaluating"></a>Suggestions for Evaluating the Materials
</h3>

<p>
    I would recommend that instructors who wish to evaluate these materials
    for possible adoption look first at 
<script language="JavaScript1.4" type="text/javascript"><!--
    document.writeln(citeLinkChapter('scatterplots') + ', ' +
                     citeLinkChapter('correlation') + ', and ' +
                     citeLinkChapter('regression') + '. ');
// -->
</script>
    Those chapters illustrate several aspects of the text:
    dynamic exercises, the use of real data in examples and exercises,
    the histogram and scatterplot applets, and the gradual introduction of new
    functionality (buttons and displayed statistics) into the applets as students
    learn new concepts.
    For example, when the scatterplot applet arrives in 
<script language="JavaScript1.4" type="text/javascript"><!--
    document.writeln(citeLinkChapter('scatterplots') + ', ');
// -->
</script>
    its only controls change the
    variables plotted, list the data, show univariate statistics of the variables
    in the dataset (summary statistics covered in the first two chapters),
    and display the coordinates of the cursor.
    (Selecting a row in the data listing highlights the corresponding point
    in the scatterplot.)
    In
<script language="JavaScript1.4" type="text/javascript"><!--
    document.writeln(citeLinkChapter('correlation') + ', ');
// -->
</script> 
    the scatterplot applet
    acquires the correlation coefficient, and a button to show graphically
    the standard deviations of the two variables plotted; it is also invoked to
    display randomly generated data that attain a given value of the correlation
    coefficient.
    It also starts to allow students to add points by clicking on the plot,
    to see the effect of additional data on the correlation coefficient.
    In 
<script language="JavaScript1.4" type="text/javascript"><!--
    document.writeln(citeLinkChapter('regression') + ', ');
// -->
</script>
    the same applet gains buttons to show the
    graph of averages, the SD line, and the regression line.
</p>

<p>
    After those chapters, I would recommend looking at the collection of Java applets to see
    how various concepts are presented graphically; in particular, be sure to see the applets
    for <a href="../../Java/Html/Venn.htm" target="lablet">Venn diagrams</a>, <a
    href="../../Java/Html/SampleMean.htm" target="lablet">sampling distributions</a>, <a
    href="../../Java/Html/Ci.htm" target="lablet">confidence intervals</a>, and the <a
    href="../../Java/Html/lln.htm" target="lablet">Law of Large Numbers</a>.
    To see how tables of
    probabilities are eliminated, see the applets for the <a href="../../Java/Html/NormHiLite.htm"
    target="lablet">Normal Distribution</a>,
    <a href="../../Java/Html/tHiLite.htm" target="lablet">Student's
    t-Distribution</a>, and the <a href="../../Java/Html/chiHiLite.htm" target="lablet">Chi-square
    Distribution</a>.
    I would recommend then looking at 
<script language="JavaScript1.4" type="text/javascript"><!--
    document.writeln(citeLinkChapter('montyHall') + ', ' + 
                     citeLinkChapter('montyHallTest') +  ', ' + 
                     citeLinkChapter('experiments') + ', and ' +
                     citeLinkChapter('percentageTests') + '. '
                     );
// -->
</script>    
    Instructors with an interest in logic or who teach general education courses might
    enjoy 
<script language="JavaScript1.4" type="text/javascript"><!--
    document.writeln(citeLinkChapter('logic') + ', and ' + citeLinkChapter('fallacies') + '. ');
// -->
</script>
    The first of those has exercises that parse logical expressions the students type in.

    Philip has served on the Technical Advisory Boards of two online publishing
    firms, an online data mining company and a photo search engine.
    He was the Faculty Assistant for
    Educational Technology at The University of California, Berkeley, from
    2001&ndash;2003 and chaired the U.C. Berkeley Educational Technology Committee from
    2001&ndash;2005.
    Philip does not like to be called &quot;Phil.&quot;
    He likes open-source software, dislikes email attachments,
    runs 100 mile endurance trail races, roasts his own coffee,
    and thinks this book is proof that obsessive-compulsive disorder is a job qualification.
    Philip lives in Berkeley, California, with a laptop, an iPhone, an Olympia Cremina,
    Porlex and Zassenhaus hand mills, muddy homemade huaraches, and an embarrassing 
    number of LED flashlights.

    This project would not have been possible without Ofer Licht, who gave
    competent, intelligent, and congenial answers to my then-noobie questions about
    Java and JavaScript, pointed me to lots of useful material, and who wrote the
    original server-side Perl cgi scripts for grading homework and querying the grade
    database.
    Duncan Temple Lang was also
    a helpful and sympathetic resource regarding the intricacies and nuisances of Java
    1.0; in addition, he is primarily responsible for the multi-threaded data server
    used to load large data sets (home-grown technology that anticipates Ajax).
    I am grateful to Rudy Guerra, who co-wrote an earlier
    version of the chapter on counting and the assignment on experiments.
    My friend and mentor David A. Freedman, and the excellent &quot;dead-tree
    book&quot; <em>Statistics</em> by Freedman, Pisani, and Purves, were inspirational.
    Aviva Shimelman worked <em>all</em> the exercises and was instrumental in streamlining
    the prose and visual style. 
    Deirdre Lynch made several valuable suggestions regarding the user interface, and
    Sydney Jones was extremely helpful in identifying problems with flow, organization,
    consistency, and prose.
    Faculty who taught from these materials and made valuable 
    suggestions include Ani Adhikari, L. Jay Citron, Yehuda Klein, Mark Lindeman,
    Aviva Shimelman and Margaret Smith.
    I am grateful for their help and their courage to experiment with a new 
    medium and new mode of teaching.
    Many students have found typos over the years: Thank you!
