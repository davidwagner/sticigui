<h1>
    Measures of Location and Spread
</h1>

<p>
    Summarizing data can help us understand them, especially when the number
    of data is large.
    This chapter presents several ways to summarize quantitative data by a typical value
    (a measure of <em>location</em>, such as the mean, median, or mode) and a measure of
    how well the typical value represents
    the list (a measure of <em>spread</em>, such as the range, inter-quartile range, or
    standard deviation).
    Markov's and Chebychev's inequalities show that these summary measures
    can contain a surprisingly large amount of information
    about the data.

    Measures of Location
</h2>

</p>

<p>
    The farthest one can reduce a set of data, and still retain any
    information at all, is to summarize the data with a single value.
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#location">Measures of location</a> do just that: They
    try to capture with a single number what is typical of the data.
    What single number is most representative of an entire list of numbers?
    We cannot say without defining &quot;representative&quot; more
    precisely.
    We will study three common measures of location: the
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#mean">mean</a>,
    the <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#median">median</a>, and the <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#mode">mode</a>.
    The mean, median and mode are all &quot;most representative,&quot;
    but for different, related notions of representativeness.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
    We saw the median in 
<script language="JavaScript1.4" type="text/javascript"><!--
    document.writeln(citeLinkChapter('histograms') + '. ');
// -->
</script>
    The median is the number that divides the (ordered) data in half&mdash;the smallest
    number that is at least as big as half the data.
    At least half the data are equal to or smaller than the median, and at least
    half the data are equal to or greater than the median.
    </li>
    <li>
    The mode of a set of data (as opposed to the mode of a histogram) is the most
    common value among the data.
    It is rare that several data coincide exactly, unless the variable is discrete,
    or the measurements are reported with low precision.
    </li>
    <li>
    The mean (more precisely, the arithmetic mean) is commonly called the average.
        It is the sum of the data, divided by the number of data:

    It is hard to see the connection between the mean, median, and mode from their

    <a id="optim_char"></a>
    However, the mean, the median, and the mode are &quot;as close as possible&quot; to all
    the data: For each of these three measures of location, the sum of the distances
    between each datum and the measure of location is as small as it can be.
    The differences among the three measures of location are in how &quot;distance&quot;
    is defined.

    The mean, median, and mode can be related (approximately) to the

    loosely speaking, the <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#mode">mode</a>
    is the highest bump, the <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#median">median</a> is where
    half the area is to the right and half is to the left, and the

    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#histogram">histogram</a> would balance, were it a solid object
    cut out of a uniform block of metal.

<p>
    In general, the <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#mean">mean</a>
    and the <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#median">median</a> need not be close together.
    If the data have a <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#symmetric">symmetric</a> distribution,
    the mean and median are exactly equal, but if the distribution of the data is
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#skewed">skewed</a>, the difference between mean and the median
    can be large.
    This is because data in the tails of the distribution
    have a lot of leverage on the <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#mean">mean</a>, just as a light person
    can balance a much heavier one on a teeter-totter if she sits much farther from the
    fulcrum than the heavier person does.
    The median is smaller than the mean if the data are skewed to the right, and
    larger than the mean if the data are skewed to the left.
    Because the <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#mean">mean</a> is
    (essentially) the balance point of the <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#histogram">histogram</a>, a
    small number of data can affect it a great deal, if they are very large (positive or
    negative).
    Corrupting just one datum can make the mean arbitrarily large or small.
</p>

<p>
    The <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#median">median</a> is affected much less by small subsets of the
    data.
    To make the median arbitrarily large or small, one must corrupt half the data.
    Corrupting just one datum changes the median by a limited amount, and not at all if
    one of the observations above the median is made larger, or one of the observations
    below the median is made smaller.
    Statistics that are not affected too much by small
    subsets of the data are <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#resistance">resistant</a>.
    The median is resistant; the mean is not.
</p>

<p>
    Which measure of location is the most appropriate depends on the intended use of the
    summary.
    If we are interested in a total, the mean tends to be the most relevant, because the
    mean is equal to the total divided by the number of data.
    For example, the mean income of the individuals in a family indicates how much the
    family can spend on each family member's necessities of life.
    On the other hand, the median can be much more informative in other situations.
</p>

<p>
    Suppose we want to know how much money a family can afford to spend on housing.
    That depends on the total family income, which is the mean income of the family
    members, times the number of family members.
    For a family of five, consisting of two parents who work and three children
    with no income, the mean income, times five, is the total amount of money the
    family makes each year.
    The median income of these five family members is zero, because more than half of
    them make nothing.
</p>

<p>
    On the other hand, suppose we want to decide whether a country is affluent.
    At issue, in some sense, is whether most of the citizens have a high income.
    The mean family income could be quite high even if most families earn essentially
    nothing&mdash;if income is highly concentrated in a few very wealthy families.
    Then the median family income would be a more meaningful measure:
    At least half the families make no more than the median, and at least half make at
    least as much as the median.
</p>

<p>
    Similarly, suppose you are applying for a job as an architect at several large firms,
    and you want to get an idea of how much money you might expect to be earning in five
    years if you join a particular firm.
    Consider the salaries of architects in each firm five years after they are hired.
    Just one very high salary could make the mean salary high, so the mean might not
    reflect what is typical.
    On the other hand, half the architects make the median salary or less, and half
    make the median salary or more, so the median would give you a better idea of a
    typical salary.
</p>

<p>
    Choosing a measure of location favorable to one's point of view is a common way
    to mislead people with statistics.
    For example, suppose you are the CEO of a company that makes gizmos and gadgets.
    It might be in your interest to claim to your customers that you have lowered
    your prices, and to claim to your shareholders that you have raised your prices.
    Suppose that last year, you sold 100,000 gizmos at $10 each, and 1,000 gadgets at
    $1000 each.
    This year, you sold 100,000 gizmos at $8 each, and 1,000 gadgets at $1200 each

<p>
    The median price of the 101,000 items sold last year is $10, because
    more than half of the items sold were gizmos. The median price of the 101,000 items sold
    this year is $8. The mean price on the price list (without regard for the number of items
    sold) was $505 last year and $604 this year. The mean price of the 101,000 items sold last
    year is
</p>

<p class="math">
    (100,000 &times; $10 + 1,000 &times; $1,000)/101,000 = $19.80
</p>

<p>
    while this year it is
</p>

<p class="math">
   (100,000 &times; $8 + 1,000 &times; $1,200)/101,000 = $19.80.
</p>

<p>
    The mean price per item sold is the same in both years: the total
    revenue was the same, and the number of items sold was the same.
    The moral is that one can make data appear to tell conflicting stories by
    choosing a measure of location disingenuously.

    <p>
        Measures of location summarize a list of numbers
        by a &quot;typical&quot; value.
    </p>
    <p>
        The three most common measures of location are the mean, the median,
        and the mode.
    </p>
    <p>
        The mean is the sum of the values, divided by the number of values.
        It has the smallest possible sum of squared differences from
        members of the list.
    </p>
    <p>
        The median is the middle value in the sorted list.
        It is the smallest number that is at least as big as at least half the
        values in the list.
        It has the smallest possible sum of absolute differences from
        members of the list.
    </p>
    <p>
        The mode is the most frequent value in the list (or one of the most
        frequent values, if there are more than one).
        It differs from the fewest possible members of the list.

    Measures of location summarize what is typical of elements of a list,
    but not every element is typical.
    Are all the elements close to each other?
    Are most of the elements close to each other?
    What is the biggest difference between elements?
    On the average, how far are the elements from each other?

    Consider three mechanical golfers
    (this example is from <a href="references.htm#hooke">Hooke, 1983</a>).
    In golf, the object is to get a low score&mdash;to take fewer strokes to complete the course.
    Suppose the golfers play as shown in
<script language="JavaScript1.4" type="text/javascript"> <!--

    The golfers' <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#average">average</a> scores are
    equal&mdash;nominally, they are equally skilled.
    However, consider what happens when they play each other.
    Golfer 1 beats golfer 2 when golfer 2 scores 73, which happens 75% of the time.
    Golfer 2 beats golfer 3 when golfer 3 scores 74, and when golfer 3 scores 70 and
    golfer 2 scores 69.
    The first occurs half the time, and, assuming that the players' scores
    are <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#independent">independent</a> (we'll get to that notion in
<script language="JavaScript1.4" type="text/javascript"><!--
    document.writeln(citeLinkChapter('probabilityAxioms') + '), ');
// -->
</script>
    the second occurs 50% &times; 25% = 12.5% of the time, so golfer 2 beats golfer 3 62.5% of the
    time.
    Finally, golfer 3 beats golfer 1 when golfer 3 scores 70, namely, 50% of the time (they play evenly).
    Their average scores are equal, but 1 beats 2 more often than not, 2 beats 3
    more often than not, and 3 plays 1 even.
    This shows that there is more going on than the average scores indicate:
    variability matters too.
</p>

<p>
    Here is another example of the importance of variability.
    The average number of children under 18 per family in the US was
    0.89 according to the 1990 census, so the average family size is about
    2.9 people (is this logic sound? what is a family?).
    If you were in the construction business, that might suggest to you that a
    two-bedroom home is the right size to build for the average American family (two parents
    sharing a room, and another room for the 0.89 children).
    However, family sizes vary over quite a large range; indeed, the same report shows
    that the average number of children for
    families that have children is 1.86, so families that have children would tend to need a
    three bedroom home, rather than a two bedroom home, if the children are to have their own
    rooms.

    Much information is lost in reducing a list of numbers to a single summary number, such
    as the mean or median.
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#location">Measures of location</a> alone are not

    We need more than just the mean or median to tell these distributions apart.
    In
<script language="JavaScript1.4" type="text/javascript"> <!--

    the data cluster both in the middle and at the ends.
    In

</script>
    is extremely concentrated: The data are
    much closer to each other than in the other two examples.
    Measures of spread or variability summarize
    with a single number whether the observations tend to cluster near the center of the
    distribution, or how spread out they are.
    If the spread is small, most of the data are nearly equal; if the spread is
    large, there are large differences among the data.

    <a id="range_IQR_SD"></a>The three most common measures of

    It is the width of the smallest interval that

    It is not <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#resistant">resistant</a>,
    because changing just one datum can make it arbitrarily large.
</p>
</div>

<p>
    <a id="iqr"></a>The <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#IQR">IQR</a> is the
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#uq">upper quartile</a>
    (75th <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#percentile">percentile</a>),
    <em>minus</em> the <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#lq">lower quartile</a>
    (25th <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#percentile">percentile</a>).
    It is the width of the interval that
    contains the middle 50% of the data&mdash;and thus is a measure of spread.
    It is insensitive to the most extreme values of the data (assuming that there are more
    than four data).
    The <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#IQR">IQR</a> is
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#resistant">resistant</a>:
    changing just one datum has a limited effect on it.
    Note that neither the <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#range">range</a> nor the

    numbers, despite their names&mdash;each is a single number.
</p>

<p>
    <a id="rms"></a>The <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#rms">rms</a> (root mean square) of a list
    measures the average size of its entries.
    It is defined as follows:
</p>

<p class="math">
    <strong><a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#rms">rms</a> = square-root( (sum
    of the squares of the entries)/(number of entries) )
</p>

<p class="math">
    =[ (sum of squares of the entries)/(number of entries) ]<sup>&frac12;</sup>.</strong>
</p>

<p>
   (Recall that a number raised to the one-half power is the square-root of
    the number; this is the notation we shall use from now on.
    If you need to review exponentiation, see
    <a href="../Problems/index.htm" target="_self">Assignment 0</a>.)
</p>

<p>
   In computing the rms, we divide by the number of entries <em>before</em> taking the square-root.
   What difference does it make to square the entries?
   Squaring them makes every term in the sum positive, so positive and negative entries
   do not cancel.
   If we ignored the square and the square root, we would just have the mean
   of the list, which could be zero, even if all the numbers were large in magnitude,
   because positive and negative entries could cancel.
   Squaring the entries before averaging them prevents cancellations.
</p>

<p>
   The rms is not the only measure of the average size of the elements of a list;
   for example, the average absolute value of the terms is another measure of the
   typical size of elements in a list.
   The rms is used more often.

    the elements of a list is
    not generally equal to the square of the <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#mean">mean</a> of the elements
    of the list: the square of the mean is 0, but the mean of the squares is not.
</p>

<p>

    <a id="sd"></a>The standard deviation (<a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#sd">SD</a>) of a list is

    measured by the <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#rms">rms</a>.
    The SD measures how spread out the data are around their mean.
    To find the SD, we first find the mean of the list, then make a list of

    deviations from the mean
    (the square-root of the average of the squares of the deviations).
    In the example just given, the mean is zero, so the

<p>
    The units of the <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#sd">SD</a> are the same as the
    original units of measurement.
    For example, if the list is comprised of measurements of
    heights in inches, the <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#sd">SD</a> has units of inches.
    Recall that the rms of a list is zero if and only if all the elements in the list are zero.
    Thus the SD of a list is zero if and only if all the deviations from the mean are
    zero, that is, if and only if all the elements are equal to each other (and hence
    equal to their mean).
    Similarly, the range of a list is zero if and only if all the elements are equal.
    In contrast, the IQR of a list can be zero even if not all the elements are the
    same&mdash;only the middle 50% of the observations need to be equal for the IQR to be zero.
</p>

<p>
    For reference, the <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#sd">SD</a>s of the data plotted in the three
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#histogram">histograms</a> above are 1.66, 1.15, and 0, respectively.
    Does that reflect how spread out they appear to be?
</p>

<p>
    Some calculators have a button labeled <strong>s</strong>, which computes
    something related to the <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#sd">SD</a> as we have defined it.
    In the usual definition of <strong>s</strong>, the sum of squares of residuals from the
    mean is divided by (number of data &minus;1) rather than by (number of data) before
    taking the square-root.
    This is called the <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#sample_sd">sample standard deviation</a>.
    When the number of data is large, there is not much difference between the
    standard deviation and the sample standard deviation, but when the number of
    data is small, the difference can be big.
</p>

<p>
    The following exercises check that you can calculate measures of spread,
    and that you understand what they mean.

    </p>
    <p>
        Measures of spread summarize how much members of a list of numbers
        differ from each other.
    </p>
    <p>
        The three most common measures of spread are the
        <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#range">range</a>, the
        <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#IQR">inter-quartile range</a>,
        and the
        <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#sd">standard deviation</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The range is the largest element of the list, minus the smallest
        element of the list: the maximum difference between elements
        of the list.
        It is sensitive only to the most extreme values in the list.
        The range of a list is zero if and only if all the elements of the
        list are equal.
    </p>
    <p>
        The inter-quartile range (IQR) is the upper quartile of the list
        (75th percentile) minus the lower quartile of the list (25th percentile).
        It measures the width of the interval that contains the middle
        50% of the data.
        It is not sensitive to the extreme values of the list.
        The IQR of a list is zero if (at least) the middle 50% of the values
        are equal.
    </p>
    <p>
        The standard deviation (SD) is the average distance from the data to
        their mean (the rms of the deviations of the
        data from their mean).
        It depends on the values of all the data.
        The SD of a list is zero if and only if all the elements in the list
        are equal (to each other, and hence to their mean).

<p>
    Some variables have simple relationships to other variables, for example,
    measurements of elevation above sea level in feet, and measurements of
    elevation above sea level in meters: Each elevation in meters above sea level is
    0.3048 times the corresponding elevation in feet above sea level.
    When the relationship between variables is simple,
    so is the relationship between their measures of location and spread.
    An <em><a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#affine">affine</a> transformation</em> or
    <em>change of variables</em> is particularly simple.
    Affine transformations have the equation of a line:
</p>

<p class="math">
    (transformed value of x) = <em>a</em> &times; (original value of x) + <em>b</em>,
</p>

<div class="indent">
<p class="inline">
    where a and b are constants.
    (Some books call this a <em>linear transformation</em>, because it has the
    equation of a straight line.)

</script>
    For example, height in inches is related to height in
    feet by an affine transformation, with <em>a</em> = 12 and <em>b</em> = 0:
</p>
</div>

<p class="math">
    (height in inches) = 12 &times; (height in feet) + 0.
</p>

<p>
    Similarly, temperature in degrees Fahrenheit is related to temperature in degrees
    Centigrade by an affine transformation with <em>a</em> = 9/5 and <em>b</em> = 32:
</p>

<p class="math">
    (temp in <sup>&deg;</sup>F) = 9/5 &times; (temp in <sup>&deg;</sup>C) + 32.
</p>

<p>
    Currencies are related to each other by affine transformations as well, with
    <em>a</em> = (exchange rate) and <em>b</em> = 0.
</p>

<p>
    The measures of location and spread introduced in this chapter behave quite
    regularly when a list is transformed by an affine transformation.

<p>
    Measures of location and spread can tell us a great deal about lists of numbers.
    For example, for any list, at least half the numbers in the list are no larger
    than the <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#median">median</a>, and at least half the numbers in the list
    are at least as large as the median (this is one way of defining the median).
    The mean and SD also can tell us about the fractions of values in a list in various ranges.
</p>

<p>
    Suppose that a list of numbers contains no negative number, and that 10% of the values
    in the list are greater than or equal to 50.
    What is the smallest the mean of the list could be?
    The mean would be smallest if all the values in the list were as small as they could be,
    subject to the constraints that the values were not negative, and 10% equal or exceed 50.
    If 90% of the values were equal to zero, and the rest were equal to 50, that would
    give the smallest mean:
</p>

<p class="math">
    0 &times; 0.9 + 50 &times; 0.1 = 5.
</p>

<p>
    That is, if a list contains no negative number, and 10% of the numbers in the
    list are 50 or larger, then the mean of the list must be at least 5.
    More generally, if any particular fraction of values in a list exceeds a given
    threshold, and none of the values in the list is negative, then the mean of
    the list cannot be arbitrarily small.
    <span class="termOfArt">Markov's inequality</span> turns this idea upside down to limit the fraction
    of numbers in a list that can exceed any given threshold, provided the list
    contains no negative number.
    The limit depends on the mean of the list, and the threshold (see

    There are 200 students in a class.
    The average amount of money in their pockets is $15. How many
    could have $75 or more in their pockets?
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Solution. </strong>No student can have a negative
    amount of money in his or her pocket, so Markov's inequality applies.
    Markov's inequality guarantees that
</p>
<p class="math">
    [fraction of students with at least $75 in their pockets] &le; $15/$75 = 0.2 =
    20%.
</p>
<p>
    Thus at most 20% of the students (40
    students) could have $75 or more in their pockets.
</p>
</div>

<p>
    If we know the mean of a list and its SD, we know something
    about how many of the numbers in the list must be in various ranges.
    Suppose that 25% of the numbers in a list differ from the mean by 30 or more.
    How small could the SD of the list be?
    To make the SD smallest, all the numbers should be as close as possible to the mean,
    subject to the constraint that at least 25% of them differ from the mean by 30 or more.
    This is achieved by making 75% of the numbers equal to the mean, 12.5% equal to the
    mean minus 30, and 12.5% equal to the mean plus 30.
    Thus the SD of the list must be at least
</p>

<p class="math">
    ( 0.125 &times; 30<sup>2</sup> + 0.75 &times; 0<sup>2</sup> + 0.125 &times;
      30<sup>2</sup> )<sup>&frac12;</sup> =  15.
</p>

<p>
    More generally, if a particular fraction of the values differ from the mean of the
    list by at least a given threshold, then the SD of the list cannot be too small.
    <em>Chebychev's inequality</em> turns this around to find a bound on the fraction of numbers
    in the list that differ from the mean by more than any given threshold.
    The bound depends on the SD of the list and the threshold.

      of weights in a given range from the
      mean and SD of a list of weights.

    The mean weight of
    students in a certain class of students is 140 lbs., and the SD of their weights is 30
    lbs. What fraction weighs between 90 lbs. and 190 lbs.?
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Solution.</strong> We cannot get an
    exact answer, but we can get a lower bound using Chebychev's inequality.
    The range from 90 lbs. to 190 lbs. is the mean, plus or minus 50 lbs.
    50 lbs. is 1 2/3 times the SD of the
    weights, so according to Chebychev's inequality, the fraction of students who weigh less
    than 90 lbs. or more than 190 lbs. is at most
</p>

<p class="math">
    1/(1 2/3)<sup>2</sup> = 1/(1.6667)<sup>2</sup>
     = 0.36 = 36%.
</p>

<p>
    Thus the fraction who weigh between 90&nbsp;lbs. and 190&nbsp;lbs.
    is at least 100% &minus; 36% = 64%.
</p>

<p>
    In some problems, it is possible to apply both Markov's inequality
    and Chebychev's inequality.
    When that happens, use whichever inequality gives the more precise answer&mdash;that
    is, the inequality that limits the fraction most stringently.
<script language="JavaScript1.4" type="text/javascript"> <!--
    citeExample()

</script>
    illustrates this idea.
</p>

<div class="example">

    On the average, it
    takes 45 minutes to cross the San Francisco Bay Bridge during rush hour.
    The SD of the
    time it takes to cross the bridge is 15 minutes.
    What's the largest fraction of the time it
    could take more than 2 hours to cross the bridge?
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Solution.</strong> Travel time is
    positive, so we can use Markov's inequality.
    By Markov's inequality,
</p>
<p class="math">
    [fraction of the time it takes more than 2
    hours] &le; (45 minutes)/(2 hours)<br />
    = (45 minutes)/(120 minutes)<br />
    = 0.375 = 37.5%.
</p>

<p>
   On the other hand, we can also apply
   Chebychev's inequality, as follows.
</p>
<p class="math">
    2 hours = 120 minutes = 45 minutes + 75
    minutes = mean time + 75 minutes = mean time + 5SD.
</p>
<p>
    That is, two hours is 5SD above the mean. On
    the other hand, 5SD below the mean is
</p>
<p class="math">
    45 minutes &minus; 5&times;(15 minutes) = &minus;30 minutes.
</p>
<p>
    This is not a possible travel time (it always takes a positive amount of time to cross the bridge).
    Thus the fraction of the time it takes more than 2 hours or less than &minus;30&nbsp;minutes to
    cross the bridge must equal the time it takes more than 2 hours to cross the bridge.
    By Chebychev's inequality,
</p>
<p class="math">
    [fraction of the time it takes less than &minus;30
    minutes or more than 2 hours] &le; 1/5<sup>2</sup><br />
    = 1/25 = 4%.
</p>
<p>
    Because the fraction of the time it takes
    more than 2 hours or less than &minus;30 minutes to cross the bridge is the same as the time it
    takes more than 2 hours, we have
</p>
<p class="math">
    [fraction of the time it takes more than 2
    hours] &le; 4%.
</p>
<p>
    This is a more restrictive bound than the one Markov's
    inequality gives in this problem (Markov's inequality gave 37.5%) so we should use
    it instead.
    (Larger lower bounds are better; smaller upper bounds are better.)

<h2><a id="summary"></a>Summary</h2>

<p>
    This chapter introduced several ways to summarize lists of numbers,
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#quantitative">quantitative data</a>.
    Some summaries, <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#location">measures of location</a>,
    seek to be as close as
    possible to every element of the list&mdash;to typify the elements.
    The <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#mean">mean</a>,
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#median">median</a>, and
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#mode">mode</a> are
    examples:
    They represent typical values of the list.
    The mean, median, and mode each are &quot;as
    close as possible&quot; to all the elements in the list,
    for different definitions of the proximity
    of two numbers: for the mean, the distance between two numbers is the square of their
    difference; for the median, the distance between two numbers is the absolute value of their
    difference; and for the mode, the distance between two numbers is 1
    if the numbers differ, 0 if
    they are equal.
    The mean is the sum of the elements, divided by the number of elements.
    The median is the smallest element that is at least as large as at least half the elements.
    The mode is the most common value in the list.
    The mode makes sense for <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#qualitative">qualitative</a> and
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#categorical">categorical</a> data as well as
    quantitative data, but the mean and median make sense only for quantitative data.
    The mean, median, and mode differ in their sensitivity to changes to the
    data, or <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#resistant">resistance</a>.
    A statistic that can be changed arbitrarily by altering a single datum is
    not resistant.
    The median is resistant.
    The mean is not resistant.
    The resistance of the mode depends on the distribution of values in the list.
</p>
<p>
    The <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#rms">rms (root mean square)</a> measures the average size of the
    elements of a list, without regard to their signs.
    The rms is not resistant.
    Other summaries, <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#spread">measures of spread</a>,
    reflect how the values of the list differ from each other.
    Examples include the <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#range">range</a>, the
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#sd">SD (standard deviation)</a>, and the
    <a href="#IQR">IQR (inter-quartile range)</a>.
    The range of a list of numbers is the largest number
    minus the smallest number.
    The range is zero if and only if all the numbers in the list are
    equal.
    The range is not resistant.
    The SD measures the average size of the differences between
    the mean and the elements of the list: It is the rms of the list of deviations from the mean.
    The SD of a list is zero if and only if all the numbers in the list are equal.
    The SD is not
    resistant.  The IQR is the upper quartile minus the lower quartile. It is the width of an
    interval that contains the middle half of the data&mdash;25% below the median and 25% above the
    median.  The IQR can be zero even if not all the numbers are equal, but the middle 50% must be
    equal. The IQR is resistant.
    If the units of measurement change by an affine transformation,
    measures of location and spread in the new units of measurement have simple relationships to
    their values in the old units.
</p>
<p>
    Measures of location and spread contain a surprising amount of
    information about lists of numbers:
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#markov">Markov's inequality</a> limits the fraction of elements of the
    list that exceed any given threshold, in terms of the mean of the list and the
    threshold, provided
    the list contains no negative number.
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#chebychev">Chebychev's inequality</a> limits the fraction of elements
    whose difference from the mean of the list exceeds any given threshold, in terms of the
    SD of the list and the threshold.
