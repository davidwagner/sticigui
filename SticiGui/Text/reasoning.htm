<h1><a id="fallacy"></a>
    Reasoning and Fallacies
</h1>

<p>
    This chapter reviews logical rules that produce valid arguments and common rule violations
    that lead to fallacies.
    Understanding fallacies helps us to avoid committing them and to recognize fallacious
    arguments made by others.
</p>

<p>
   Reasoning can be <em>inductive</em> or <em>deductive</em>.
   Deductive reasoning is what we call &quot;logic&quot; informally.
   It is a way of thinking mathematically about all kinds of things:
   Given a set of assumptions (premises), what must then be true?
   In contrast, inductive reasoning attempts to generalize from experience (data) to new situations:
   How strong is the evidence that something is true or false about the world?
   Inductive reasoning is inherently uncertain.
   Deductive reasoning&mdash;if logical&mdash;is as certain as
   mathematics can be.
   Much of the meat of Statistics, covered in other chapters, concerns inductive reasoning.
   Exceptional care is needed to draw reliable conclusions by inductive reasoning.
   And good inductive reasoning requires correct deductive reasoning, the subject of this chapter.
</p>

<p>
    Deductive reasoning that is mathematically correct (logical) is <span class="termOfArt">valid</span>.
    Deductive reasoning that is incorrect (logically faulty, illogical) is
    <span class="termOfArt">fallacious</span>.
    Reasoning can be valid even if the assumptions on which it is based are false.
    If reasoning is valid <em>and</em> based on true premises, it is
    <span class="termOfArt">sound</span>.
</p>

<p>
    Many deductive and inductive arguments rely on statistical evidence.
    Even the best statistical evidence can lead to wrong conclusions if it is used in
    a fallacious argument.
    The difficulty many people have understanding statistics makes statistics
    especially effective &quot;red herrings&quot; to distract the listener.
    Moreover, statistics can give fallacious arguments an undeserved air of scientific precision.

<h3><a id="arguments"></a>Arguments
</h3>

</p>

<p>
    An <span class="termOfArt">argument</span> is a sequence of statements, one of
    which is called the <span class="termOfArt">conclusion</span>.
    The other statements are <span class="termOfArt">premises</span> (assumptions).
    The argument presents the premises&mdash;collectively&mdash; as evidence that the
    conclusion is true.
    For instance, the following is an argument:
</p>

<p class="example">
    <span class="math">If A is true then B is true.</span>
    <span class="math">A is true.</span>
    <span class="math">Therefore, B is true.</span>
</p>

<div class="indent">
<p class="inline">
    The <span class="termOfArt">conclusion</span> is that <span class="math">B is true</span>.
    The <span class="termOfArt">premises</span> are <span class="math">If A is true then B is true</span>
    and <span class="math">A is true.</span>
    The premises support the conclusion that <span class="math">B is true</span>.
    The word &quot;therefore&quot; is not part of the conclusion: It is a signal that the statement after it
    is the conclusion.
<script language="JavaScript1.8" type="text/javascript"><!--
    var fStr = 'A special symbol is often used to flag the conclusion of an argument.  One symbol ' +
               'often used to signal that the statement after it is the conclusion is three dots ' +
               'forming the vertices of an equilateral triangle: &there4;, pronounced &quot;therefore.&quot;';
    writeFootnote(fCtr++, fCtr.toString(), fStr);
// -->
</script>
    The words <em>thus</em>, <em>hence</em>, <em>so</em>, and the phrases <em>it follows that</em>,
    <em>we see that</em>, and so on, also flag conclusions.
    The words <em>suppose</em>, <em>let</em>, <em>given</em>, <em>assume</em>, and so on, flag premises.
</p>
</div>

<p>
    A concrete argument of the form just given might be:
</p>

<p class="example">
    If it is sunny, I will wear sandals. It is sunny.  Therefore, I will wear sandals.
</p>

<p>
    Here, <span class="math">A</span> is &quot;it is sunny&quot; and
    <span class="math">B</span> is &quot;I will wear sandals.&quot;
</p>

<p>
    We usually omit the words &quot;is true.&quot;
    So, for example, the previous argument would be written
</p>

<p class="math">If A then B.</span> <span class="math">A.</span>
    <span class="math">Therefore, B.</span>
</p>

<div class="indent">
<p class="inline">
    The statement <span class="math">not A</span>

<h3><a id="valid_sound"></a>Validity and Soundness
</h3>

<p class="video"> <iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/mnbbRtFxWHA?start=3235&end=3440" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</p>

<p>
    <span class="defSpan">An argument is <span class="termOfArt">valid</span>
    if the conclusion must be true whenever the premises are true.</span>
    In other words, an argument is valid if the truth of
    its premises guarantees the truth of its conclusion.
    Stating the conclusion explicitly is in some sense redundant, because the conclusion follows from
    the premises:
    it serves to draw our attention to the fact that that <em>particular</em> statement
    is one (of many) that must be true if the premises are true.
    <span class="defSpan">An argument that is not valid is <span class="termOfArt">invalid</span>
    or <span class="termOfArt">fallacious</span>.</span>
</p>

<p>
    If an argument is valid <em>and</em> its premises are true, the argument is
    <span class="termOfArt">sound</span>.
    If an argument is not sound it is <span class="termOfArt">unsound</span>.
    An argument can be valid even if its premises are false&mdash;but
    such an argument is unsound.
    For instance, the following argument is valid but unsound:
</p>

<p class="example">
    Cheese more than a billion years old is stale.
    The Moon is made of cheese.
    The Moon is more than a billion years old.
    Therefore, the Moon is stale cheese.
</p>

<div class="indent">
<p class="inline">
    If all three premises were true, the conclusion would have to be true.
    The argument is valid despite the fact that the Moon is not made of cheese,
    but the argument is unsound&mdash;because the Moon is not made of cheese.
<script language="JavaScript1.8" type="text/javascript"><!--
   document.writeln(citeLinkChapter('logic') + ', ');
// -->
</script>
    discusses validity and soundness in more detail.
</p>
</div>

<p>
   The logical form of the argument just above is (roughly):
</p>

<div class="indent">
<p class="example" class="inline">
   <span class="math">For any x, if x is A and x is B then x is C. y is A. y is B.
   Therefore, y is C.</span>
<script language="JavaScript1.8" type="text/javascript"><!--
    var fStr = 'There are hard, picky details hidden here. For instance, when can you substitute ' +
               '<span class="math">y</span> for <span class="math">x</span>?  Such issues are ' +
               'studied in formal logic; we will not delve that deep here. However, see ' +
               citeLinkChapter('categoricalLogic') + '. ';
    writeFootnote(fCtr++, fCtr.toString(), fStr);
// -->
</script>
</p>
</div>

<div class="indent">
<p class="inline">
   Here, <span class="math">A</span> is &quot;made of cheese,&quot; <span class="math">B</span> is
   &quot;more than a billion years old.&quot; and <span class="math">C</span> is
   &quot;stale.&quot;
   The symbol <span class="math">x</span> is a free variable that can stand for anything;
   the symbol <span class="math">y</span> stands for the Moon.
   Note that this example uses <span class="math">A, B,</span> and <span class="math">C</span>
   to represent properties of objects (categories, see
<script language="JavaScript1.8" type="text/javascript"><!--
    document.writeln(citeLinkChapter('categoricalLogic') + '), ');
// -->
</script>

</p>

<p>
    <span class="defSpan"><span class="termOfArt">Formal fallacies</span>
    are errors that result from misapplying or not following these rules.</span>
    For instance, consider the argument:
</p>

<p class="example">
      <span class="math">If A then B.</span>  <span class="math">B.</span>
         <span class="math">Therefore, A.</span>
</p>

<p>
   A concrete example of this might be:
</p>

<p class="example">
   If it is sunny, I will wear sandals. I will wear sandals.  Therefore, it is sunny.
</p>

<p>
    (I encourage you to &quot;plug in&quot; values in abstract expressions to get plain-language
    examples&mdash;not only in this chapter, but anytime you encounter a mathematical expression.
    That can really clarify the math.)
    This is a fallacy known as <span class="termOfArt">affirming the consequent</span>.
    (In the <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#conditional">conditional</a>
    <span class="math">If A then B</span>, <span class="math">A</span> is
    called the <span class="termOfArt">antecedent</span> and <span class="math">B</span> is
    called the <span class="termOfArt">consequent</span>.
    To <em>affirm</em> something is to assert that it is true; to <em>deny</em> something is to
    assert that it is false.)
    The premises say that if <span class="math">A</span> is true, <span class="math">B</span>
    must also be true.
    It does not follow that if <span class="math">B</span> is true,
    <span class="math">A</span> must also be true.
    To draw the conclusion that <span class="math">A</span> is true,
    we need an additional premise: <span class="math">If B then A</span>.
    That premise, together with the other two premises,
    would allow us to conclude that <span class="math">A</span>  is true.
</p>

<p>
   More generally, consider proving something from the premise
   <span class="math">If A then B</span> and an additional premise:
   that <span class="math">A</span> is true, that
   <span class="math">A</span> is false, that <span class="math">B</span> is true,
   or that <span class="math">B</span> is false.
</p>

<p>
   If the additional premise is that the antecedent <span class="math">A</span> is true,
   we are <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#affirming_the_antecedent">affirming the antecedent</a>,
   which allows us to reach the logically valid conclusion that <span class="math">B</span>
   is also true.
   If the additional premise is that the antecedent <span class="math">A</span> is false,
   we are <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#denying_the_antecedent">denying the antecedent</a>,
   which does <em>not</em> allow us to conclude anything about <span class="math">B</span>.
</p>

<p>
   If the additional premise is that the consequent <span class="math">B</span> is true, we are
   <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#affirming_the_consequent">affirming the consequent</a>,
   which does <em>not</em> allow us to conclude anything about <span class="math">A</span>.
   If the additional premise is that the consequent <span class="math">B</span> is false, we are
   <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#denying_the_consequent">denying the consequent</a>,
   which allows us to reach the logically valid conclusion that <span class="math">A</span> is also
   false.
</p>

<p>
    There are countless fallacies, some, such as
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#affirming_the_consequent">affirming the consequent</a>
    and <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#denying_the_antecedent">denying the antecedent</a>
    are so common they have names.
    Some do not.
</p>

<p>
    <em>Non sequitur</em> is the name of another common type of formal fallacy.
    For instance, consider the argument:
</p>

<p class="example">
      <span class="math">If A then B.</span>  <span class="math">A.</span>
         <span class="math">Therefore, C.</span>
</p>

<p>
    This is a fallacy known as <span class="termOfArt">non sequitur</span>, which is
    Latin for &quot;does not follow.&quot;
    The conclusion does not follow from the two premises.
    The premises guarantee that <span class="math">B</span> is true.
    They say nothing about <span class="math">C</span>.
    The conclusion <span class="math">B</span> follows from the premises but the conclusion
    <span class="math">C</span> does not.
    There is a missing premise: <span class="math">If B then C</span>.
    We will distinguish between two kinds of <span class="termOfArt">non sequitur</span>;
    see the box below.

</p>

<p>
    <span class="defSpan">A <span class="termOfArt">fallacy</span>
    is an argument in which the premises do not justify
    the conclusion as a matter of logic.</span>
    An argument can be fallacious for many reasons.
    The argument might mis-apply a legitimate rule of logic.
    Or it might omit a crucial premise or misconstrue a premise.
    Or it might misconstrue the conclusion.
</p>

<p>
    For instance, consider the argument: <span class="example">Mary says X is true.  Mary does Y.
    Anybody who does Y is a bad person.
    Therefore, X is false.</span>
</p>

<div class="indent">
<p class="inline">
    That argument is fallacious: It is a <span class="termOfArt">non sequitur of relevance</span>
    because the conclusion that X is false does not follow from the two premises
    (&quot;Mary does Y&quot; and &quot;Anybody who does Y is a bad person&quot;).
    The form of the argument is: <span class="math">If A then B. A.  Therefore C.</span>
<script language="JavaScript1.8" type="text/javascript"><!--
    var fStr = '<span class="math">A</span> is the proposition that Mary does Y. ' +
               '<span class="math">B</span> is the proposition that Mary is a bad person.' +
               '<span class="math">C</span> is the proposition that anything Mary says is incorrect.';
    writeFootnote(fCtr++, fCtr.toString(), fStr);
// -->
</script>
    To get to the conclusion that X is false, we would need an additional premise, namely,
    that everything a bad person says is false, that is, the
    premise <span class="math">if B then C</span>.
    If we added that premise, the argument would be
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#valid">valid</a>&mdash;but not
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#sound">sound</a>, because it is not true
    that everything bad people say is false.
</p>
</div>

<p>
    Because this fallacy has, at its heart, a
    <span class="termOfArt">non sequitur of relevance</span>, we call it a
    <span class="termOfArt">fallacy of relevance</span>.
    Instead of establishing the conclusion it claims (that X is false),
    it establishes a different conclusion (that Mary is bad) and
    ignores the difference.
    This variant of a fallacy of relevance is very common.
    It has a name, <span class="termOfArt">ad hominem</span>, which means &quot;at the person&quot; in
    Latin.
    Instead of addressing Mary's argument that X is true, it attacks Mary herself.
    <span class="termOfArt">Ad hominem</span> arguments are discussed below.
</p>
</div>

<p>
    The tacit premise that everything that comes of something bad is bad&mdash;and its
    opposite, that only good comes of good&mdash;are <span class="termOfArt">genetic fallacies</span>.
    <span class="termOfArt">Inappropriate appeal to authority</span>, discussed below, is another
    genetic fallacy.
</p>

<p>
    Consider the argument: <span class="example">All Ys are Zs. Mary says X is a Y. Therefore, X is a Z.</span>
</p>

<div class="indent">
<p class="inline">
    That argument is fallacious: It is a <span class="termOfArt">non sequitur of evidence</span>
    because the conclusion that X is a Z does not follow from the two premises
    (&quot;All Ys are Zs&quot; and &quot;Mary says X is a Y&quot;).
    The form of the argument is: <span class="math">If A then B. C.  Therefore B.</span>
<script language="JavaScript1.8" type="text/javascript"><!--
    var fStr = '<span class="math">A</span> is the proposition that X is a Y. ' +
               '<span class="math">B</span> is the proposition that X is a Z.' +
               '<span class="math">C</span> is the proposition that Mary says X is a Y.';
    writeFootnote(fCtr++, fCtr.toString(), fStr);
// -->
</script>
    To get to the conclusion that X is a Z, we would need an additional premise, namely,
    that if Mary says X is a Y, X is in fact a Y: the
    premise <span class="math">if C then A</span>.
    In words, that extra premise is &quot;if Mary says X is a Y, then X is a Y.&quot;
    If we added that premise, the argument would be
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#valid">valid</a>.
    But it would not be <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#sound">sound</a>
    unless it is impossible for Mary to be mistaken that X is a Y.
    Because this fallacy has, at its heart, a <span class="termOfArt">non sequitur of evidence</span>,
    we call it a <span class="termOfArt">fallacy of evidence</span>.
    The fallacy consists in treating one of the stated premises (Mary says X is a Y) as if it were a
    different premise (X is a Y).
    This particular kind of fallacy of evidence is common: It is an
    <span class="termOfArt">(inappropriate) appeal to authority</span>.
    There are more examples and discussion of fallacies of evidence and fallacies of relevance below.
</p>
</div>

<p>
    To sum up, many (if not all) informal fallacies are of this form: The argument is a
    <span class="termOfArt">non sequitur of relevance</span> or a
    <span class="termOfArt">non sequitur of evidence</span>.
    <span class="termOfArt">Non sequiturs of relevance</span> can
    be made valid by adding a premise that says the real conclusion implies the desired conclusion.
    <span class="termOfArt">Non sequiturs of evidence</span> can be made valid by adding a premise
    that says one of the given premises implies a necessary but missing premise.
    In both cases, the missing premise is false, so the patched argument would be
    valid but not sound.

        </p>

<p>
    A <span class="termOfArt">fallacy of relevance</span> commits a
    <span class="termOfArt">non sequitur of relevance</span>: It establishes a conclusion, but not
    the desired conclusion.
    An extra (and false) premise is needed for the actual conclusion to
    imply the desired conclusion.
    A canonical form of a fallacy of relevance is:
</p>

<p class="example">
    <span class="math">If A then B.  A.  Therefore, C.</span>&mdash;together with the real-world fact
    that <span class="math">B</span> does not imply <span class="math">C</span>.
</p>

<p>
    Alternatively, a fallacy of relevance is:
</p>

<p class="example">
    <span class="math">If A then B.  Not B.  Therefore, not C.</span>&mdash;together with the real-world fact
    that <span class="math">not A</span> does not imply <span class="math">not C</span>.
</p>

<p>
    Conversely, a <span class="termOfArt">fallacy of evidence</span> commits a
    <span class="termOfArt">non sequitur of evidence</span>: It does not establish any
    conclusion.
    An extra (and false) premise is needed for one of the stated premises to imply a
    premise that can be used to reach the desired conclusion.
    A canonical form for a fallacy of evidence is:
</p>

<p class="example">
    <span class="math">If A then B. C.

<h3><a id="relevance"></a>Fallacies of Relevance
</h3>

<p>
    Logicians often distinguish among kinds of relevance.
    <span class="defSpan">A piece of evidence is <em>positively relevant</em> to
    some assertion if it adds weight to the assertion.
    It is <em>negatively relevant</em> if it takes weight away from the assertion.
    Some evidence is <em>irrelevant</em> to a given assertion.</span>
</p>

<p>
    For instance, consider the assertion &quot;it's hot outside.&quot;
    The observation that passers-by are sweating would be positively relevant to the assertion:
    it supports the assertion that the weather is hot.
    The observation that passers-by are wearing parkas would be negatively relevant:
    it is evidence that the weather is not hot.
    The observation that passers-by are listening to mp3 players would be irrelevant.
</p>

<p>
    Many superficially persuasive arguments in fact ride on irrelevant observations.
    Here are some examples.
</p>


<div class="example">
<script language="JavaScript1.8" type="text/javascript"><!--
    var qStr = '<em>Ad hominem</em> (personal attack)';
    writeExampleCaption(qStr);

</script>

<p class="example">
    Nancy claims the death penalty is a good thing.
    But Nancy once set fire to a vacant warehouse.
    Nancy is evil.
    Therefore, the death penalty is a bad thing.
</p>

<p>
    This argument does not address Nancy's argument, it just says she must be wrong (about everything)
    because she is evil.
    Whether Nancy is good or evil is irrelevant: It has no bearing on whether her argument is sound.
</p>

<p>
    This is a fallacy of relevance:  It establishes that Nancy is bad, then equates being bad and
    never being right.
    In symbols, the argument is <span class="math">If A then B. A.  Therefore C.</span>
    (If somebody sets fire to a vacant warehouse, that person is evil.  Nancy set fire to a vacant
     warehouse.  Therefore, Nancy's opinion about the death penalty is wrong.)
</p>

<div class="indent">
<p class="inline">
    <em>Ad hominem</em> is Latin for &quot;towards the person.&quot;  An <em>ad hominem</em> argument
    attacks the person making the claim, rather than the person's reasoning.
    A variant of the <em>ad hominem</em> argument is &quot;guilt by association.&quot;
<script language="JavaScript1.8" type="text/javascript"><!--

    Bob claims the death penalty is a good thing.
    But Bob's family business manufactures caskets.
    Bob benefits when people die, so his motives are suspect.
    Therefore, the death penalty is a bad thing.
</p>

<p>
    This argument does not address Bob's argument, it addresses Bob's motives.
    His motives are irrelevant: They have nothing to do with whether his argument for the death penalty
    is sound.
</p>

<p>
    This is related to an <em>ad hominem</em> argument.
    It, too, addresses the person, not the person's argument.
    However, rather than condemning Bob as evil,
    it impugns his motives in arguing for this particular conclusion.

<p class="example">
    Amy says people shouldn't smoke cigarettes in public because cigarette smoke has a strong odor.
    But Amy wears strong perfume all the time.
    Amy is clearly a hypocrite.
    Therefore, smoking in public is fine.
</p>

<p>
    This argument does not engage Amy's argument: It attacks her for the (in)consistency
    of her opinions in this matter and in some other matter.
    Whether Amy wears strong fragrances has nothing to do with
    whether her argument against smoking is sound.
</p>

<p>
    The abstract form of this argument is also a <em>non sequitur</em>: <span class="math">If A then B. A.
    Therefore C.</span>
    (In words: If you complain about strong smells and wear strong fragrances, you are a hypocrite.
     Amy complains about strong smells and wears strong perfume; therefore, her opinion about smoking
     is incorrect.)
</p>

<p>
    <em>Tu quoque</em> is Latin for &quot;you also.&quot;
    It related to <em>ad hominem</em> arguments:
    it addresses the person rather than the person's argument.
    But instead of <em>generally</em> condemning the other party, it says that his or her claim in the
    matter at issue is hypocritical because
    it is inconsistent with something else the person has done or said.
    We are supposed to conclude that he or she must therefore be wrong on this particular point.

    Yes, I hit Billy.
    But Sally hit him first.
</p>

<p>
    This argument claims it is fine to do something wrong because somebody else did something wrong.
    The argument is of the form: <span class="math">If A then B. A.
    Therefore C.</span>
    (In words: If Sally hit Billy, it's OK for Billy to hit Sally.  Sally hit Billy.  Therefore, it's OK
     for me to hit Billy.)
</p>

<p>
    Generally, the two-wrongs-make-a-right argument says that the justified wrong happened after the
    exculpatory wrong, or was less severe.
    For instance, Sally hit Billy first, or Sally hit Billy harder than I did, or
    Sally pulled a knife on Billy.
</p>

<p>
    On the other hand, it might be quite reasonable to argue, &quot;yes, I hit Billy.
    But he was beating me with a baseball bat&mdash;I acted in self defense. &quot;
    In that case, the first &quot;wrong&quot; might justify hitting Billy, which otherwise would

    It is an argument that if you do not accept the conclusion (and give me

    The form of the argument is <span class="math">If A then B.  B is bad. Therefore, not A</span>.
    Here, <span class="math">A</span> is &quot;you don't give me your lunch money,&quot;
    <span class="math">B</span> is &quot;you will be beaten up.&quot;
    The argument conflates &quot;it is bad to be beaten up&quot; with &quot;it is false that you
    will be beaten up.&quot;
    The argument establishes the conclusion that if you don't give me your lunch money, something bad
    will happen.
    It does not establish the conclusion that you should give me your lunch money.
    There is a missing premise that relates the implicit conclusion that could be
    justified on the evidence (the if you don't give me your lunch money, something bad will happen)
    to the stated conclusion (you should give me your lunch money).
    <em>Ad baculum</em> is a fallacy of relevance, because it relies on a
    <span class="termOfArt">non sequitur of relevance</span>.
</p>
</div>

<p>
    <em>Ad baculum</em> is Latin for &quot;to the stick.&quot;
    It is essentially the argument &quot;might makes right.&quot;
</p>

<p>
    Not all arguments of the form
    <span class="math">If you do A then B will happen.  B is bad.  Therefore, don't do A</span>
    are <span class="termOfArt">ad baculum</span> arguments.
    It depends in part on whether B is a real or imposed consequence of A.
    For instance, <span class="math">If you cheat on your exam, you will feel guilty
    about it for the rest of your life; therefore, you should not cheat</span>
    is not an <span class="termOfArt">ad baculum</span> argument.
    But <span class="math">If you cheat on your exam, I will turn you in to the Student
    Conduct Office and have you expelled;
    therefore, you should not cheat</span> is an <span class="termOfArt">ad baculum</span> argument.

<p>
    This argument justifies an action not by claiming that it is correct, but
    by an appeal to pity: extenuating circumstances of a sort.

    <em>Ad misericordium</em> is Latin for &quot;to pity.&quot;
    It is an appeal to compassion rather than to reason.

    This is an example of <span class="termOfArt">equivocation</span>, a fallacy facilitated by

    This argument uses the word <em>man</em> in two different ways.
    In the first premise, the word means <em>human</em> while in the second, it means
    <em>male</em>.
    Generally, equivocation is considered a <span class="termOfArt">fallacy of relevance</span>,
    but this example fits our definition of a <span class="termOfArt">fallacy of evidence</span>.
</p>
</div>

<p>
    The logical form of this argument is <span class="math">If A then B.  Not C.  Therefore,
    B is not necessarily true.</span>
    That argument is a formal fallacy.
    There is a missing premise that equates one of the premises given
    (Sally is not male) with a different premise not given (Sally is not human).
    That is, <span class="math">if not C then not A</span>.
    That (false) premise relates evidence given to evidence not given, so this is a
    <span class="termOfArt">fallacy of evidence</span> according to our definition.
    The fact that the same word can mean &quot;human&quot; and &quot;male&quot; hides the
    formal fallacy.
</p>

<p>
    Another common structure for fallacies that involve equivocation is:
    <span class="math">All <em>P</em><sub>1</sub>s are <em>Q</em>s.
    <em>X</em> is a <em>P</em><sub>2</sub>.  Therefore, <em>X</em> is a <em>Q</em>.</span>
    The equivocation is that the same word is used to refer to <em>P</em><sub>1</sub>
    and <em>P</em><sub>2</sub>, which hides the fact that <em>P</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>P</em><sub>2</sub>
    are not the same.
</p>

<p>
    Here is an example of equivocation hiding a fallacy of relevance:
</p>

<p class="example">
    If you are a Swiss citizen living in the U.S., you are an alien (foreigner).
    Birgitte is a Swiss citizen living in California.
    Therefore, Birgitte is an Alien (from another planet).
</p>

<p>
    The structure of this example is <span class="math">For any x, if x is A then x is B.  y is A.
    Therefore, y is C.</span>
    The missing (and false) premise is that all aliens are Aliens
    (<span class="math">For any x, if x is B then x is C</span>),
    which would relate the valid conclusion (Birgitte is an alien) to the desired conclusion (Birgitte is
    an Alien).
    Thus this equivocation fallacy is a <span class="termOfArt">fallacy of relevance</a>.
</p>
</div>

<p>
    The straw man, red herring and equivocation fallacies all change the subject:
    they argue for (or against) something that is sideways to the original claim but easy to confuse
    with the original claim.
    <em>Ad hominem</em> arguments also change the subject&mdash;from whether the speaker is right
    to whether the speaker is &quot;good.&quot;
</p>

<div class="example">
<script language="JavaScript1.8" type="text/javascript"><!--
    var qStr = '<em>Petitio principii</em> (begging the question)';
    writeExampleCaption(qStr);
// -->
</script>

<p class="example">
    There is no circumstance that justifies killing another person.
    The death penalty involves killing another person.
    Therefore, even if someone commits a brutal murder, he should not be put to death.
</p>

<p>
    This argument begs the question.
    It assumes what it purports to prove, namely, that there is no circumstance
    that justifies killing.
    &quot;No circumstance&quot; already precludes &quot;commits brutal murder.&quot;
</p>

<p>
    The form of the argument is <span class="math">A.  Therefore, A.</span>
    That is indeed logically valid&mdash;it just isn't much of an argument.
    Where this &quot;fallacy&quot; gets legs is when the premise and the conclusion use
    different words to say the same thing, creating the illusion that the conclusion is
    different from the assumption.
    Here is another example:
</p>

<p class="example">
    Jack is overweight.  Therefore, Jack is fat.
</p>

<p>
    <em>Petitio principii</em> is Latin for &quot;attack the beginning.&quot;
    The premise assumes the truth of the conclusion.
    A circular argument is a variant of begging the question.

<h3><a id="evidence"></a>Fallacies of Evidence
</h3>

<p>
    This section gives examples of fallacies of evidence.
    Recall that such fallacies are of the form:
    <span class="math">If A then B.  C.  Therefore B.</span>
    There is a missing premise, namely, <span class="math">If C then A</span>.
    Without that premise, the argument is not much of an argument at all: The premises cannot be combined to
    support a conclusion other than the premises themselves (which would be a circular argument:
    <span class="math">C.  Therefore, C.</span>).
<script language="JavaScript1.8" type="text/javascript"><!--
    citeExample(xCtr);
// -->
</script>
    is of this form.
</p>

<p>
    Another form for a fallacy of evidence is:  <span class="math">If A then B.  Not C.  Therefore Not A.</span>
    Again, there is a missing premise, namely, <span class="math">If not C then not B</span>.
    And without that premise, the argument is no argument at all.
<script language="JavaScript1.8" type="text/javascript"><!--
    citeExample(xCtr+3);
// -->
</script>
    is of this form.
</p>

<p>
    Yet another fallacy is of the form: <span class="math">A.  Therefore, B.</span>
    For instance:
</p>

<div class="indent">
<p class="example" class="inline">Eat your brussels sprouts.  There are children starving in Africa.
<script language="JavaScript1.8" type="text/javascript"><!--
    var fStr = 'To which the standard response is, &quot;Send them my brussels sprouts.  I\'m not gonna ' +
               'eat them.&quot;';
    writeFootnote(fCtr++, fCtr.toString(), fStr);
// -->
</script>
</p>
</div>

<p>
   (In this argument, the premise <span class="math">A</span> is &quot;there are children starving in Africa,&quot;
    and the conclusion <span class="math">B</span> is &quot;you should eat your brussels sprouts.&quot;)
   This could be classified as a fallacy of evidence: There's a missing premise,
   <span class="math">If A then B</span>: &quot;If children are starving in
   Africa, then I should eat my brussels sprouts.&quot;
   Without that premise, the statements are not much of an argument.
</p>

<p>
    The examples of fallacies of evidence given below differ in how <span class="math">C</span>
    is related to <span class="math">A</span> and <span class="math">B</span>.
</p>
</div>

<div class="example">
<script language="JavaScript1.8" type="text/javascript"><!--
    var qStr = 'Inappropriate appeal to authority';
    writeExampleCaption(qStr);
// -->
</script>

<p class="example">
    All animals with rabies go crazy.
    Jessie says my cat has rabies.
    Therefore, my cat will go crazy.
</p>

<p>
    This argument is fallacious.
    The form of the argument is <span class="math">If A then B.  C.  Therefore, B.</span>
    There is a missing premise, namely, that if Jessie says my cat has
    rabies, then my cat has rabies (<span class="math">If C then A.</span>).
    That premise relates a stated premise (Jessie says my cat has rabies&mdash;the evidence given)
    to an unstated premise (my cat has rabies&mdash;the evidence required to be able to use the premise
    that animals with rabies go crazy).
    Thus, this is a fallacy of evidence.
</p>

<p>
    If we add that missing premise, the argument might or might not be sound, depending on
    whether Jessie could be mistaken.
    The argument is clearly stronger if Jessie is a veterinarian who tested my cat for rabies
    than if Jessie is a 5-year-old child who lives next door.
    Any time we take somebody's say-so as evidence, we are making an appeal to authority.
    That person might or might not be &quot;an authority.&quot;
</p>

<p>
    Our legal system has elaborate rules governing evidence.
    A witness can testify about what he or she saw or heard or has personal knowledge of.
    If I say &quot;Jane told me she saw Frank hotwire the car,&quot;
    all other things being equal, that could be used in court as evidence that Jane told me
    something, but not as evidence that Frank hotwired the car&mdash;it is <em>hearsay</em> because
    I am reporting something I heard about, not something I witnessed directly.
    I could not appeal to Jane's authority for evidence about Frank's actions.
    There is a big difference between &quot;I heard it&quot; and &quot;I heard of it.&quot;
</p>

<p>
    The fallacy of appealing to authority is called
    <span class="termOfArt">argumentum ad verecundiam</span>,
    argument to veneration (respect).
    A more blatant example is:
</p>

<p class="example">
   Professor Stark says <span class="math">1+1=3</span>.
   Professor Stark has a Ph.D.
   He is a learned professor of statistics at one of the world's best universities.
   He has published many scholarly articles in refereed journals, lectured in many countries,
   and written a textbook about Statistics.
   His former students hold positions at top universities, in government research agencies, and
   in the private sector.
   He has consulted for many top law firms and Fortune 100 companies.
   He has been qualified as an expert in Federal court and has testified to Congress.
   Therefore, <span class="math">1+1=3</span>.

    This argument is valid but not sound: It starts with a premise that is an artificial

    It is possible to support our soldiers and still to oppose the war in Iraq,
    so the first premise is false.

    The same false dichotomy could have been disguised in slightly different language: The first

    After nearly eight years of the Bush administration, the stock market had the largest drop

    The Republican government ruined the economy.

<p>
    It might be true that Bush administration policies led to the stock market crash.
    And it might be true that there would have been a comparable &quot;market correction&quot;
    under a Democratic administration.
    The fact that the crash occurred late in the Bush administration is not in itself proof that it

    I look up whether each of those websites is hosted in the U.S. or elsewhere.
    Seventy percent are hosted in the U.S.
    Therefore, the majority of free porn websites are hosted in the U.S.
</p>

<p>
    This is a hasty generalization.
    Even though the list is large, there is no reason it should be representative of the
    population of all free porn websites,
    with respect to the country they are hosted in or any other variable.
    The list is a sample of convenience.
    It was found by running a query in English on a U.S. search engine.
    It is just a list somebody made and that I happened to find.
</p>

<p class="example">
    To try to get a better sample, I think of more search terms.
    I run searches on a popular search engine for &quot;free porn,&quot; &quot;free sex videos,&quot;
    &quot;naked girls,&quot; &quot;hot sex,&quot; &quot;free intercourse videos,&quot; and
    15 other terms.
    For each search, I record the first 100 links to free porn websites that the search engine returns,
    producing a list of 2,000 websites.
    I look up whether each of those websites is hosted in the U.S.
    Seventy percent are; therefore, the majority of free porn websites are hosted in the U.S.
</p>

<p>
    This is still a hasty generalization from a sample of convenience.
    There is no reason the first 100 websites returned by a search engine in response to each of 20 queries I
    make up should be representative of free porn websites, with respect to host country or any other
    characteristic&mdash;and there are many reasons for it to be unrepresentative:
    More popular websites tend to be returned closer to the top of the list of results for each search.
    Queries in English tend to return links in the U.S.
    U.S. search engines tend to return links in the U.S.
    The search engine databases are not an exhaustive list of all websites.
    Other queries intended to retrieve porn websites would get different results.
    There are countless more reasons.

    Countries are like families.
    Government is like the parents, and citizens are like the children.

    This argument is of the form: <span class="math">x</span> is similar to <span class="math">y</span>

    Therefore, everything that is true for <span class="math">x</span> is true for <span class="math">y</span>.
    Another example:

<p class="example">
    Physicists are like physicians.
    Both study calculus as undergraduates;
    both have many years of education,
    culminating in advanced degrees;
    both know lots of science;
    both tend to have above average intelligence;
    both tend to be arrogant;
    both even start with the same seven letters, &quot;physici.&quot;

    Weak analogies often arise in some forms of sampling, such as
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#quota_sample">quota sampling</a> and
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#convenience_sample">convenience sampling</a>.
    A sample can resemble the population from which it is drawn in many ways, and yet be
    unrepresentative of the population with respect to the property we care about.
    The Hite report example in
<script language="JavaScript1.8" type="text/javascript"><!--
    document.writeln(citeLinkChapter('sampling') + ', ');
// -->
</script>
    shows that a sample can match the demographics of the population from which it is drawn quite accurately,
    but still be unlike the population with respect to opinions and experiences.
    One of the chief merits of <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#random_sample">random sampling</a>
    is that the resulting samples tend to be representative of the population with respect
    to all properties; moreover, we can quantify the extent to which a random sample is likely to be
    unrepresentative, and those differences tend to be smaller the larger the
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#sample_size">sample size</a>.
    For other ways of drawing samples, the samples are generally unrepresentative even
    when they are large.

    This isn't an argument because there is no conclusion, only premises, but that's not the point.
    These two premises amount to: <span class="math">A. Not A.</span>

<h2><a id="summary"></a>Summary</h2>

<p>
    An argument consists of a sequence of statements.
    One is the <span class="termOfArt">conclusion</span>; the rest are
    <span class="termOfArt">premises</span>.
    The premises are given as evidence that the conclusion is true.
    If the conclusion must be true if the premises were true, the argument is
    <span class="termOfArt">valid</span>.
    A valid argument is <span class="termOfArt">sound</span> if its premises are true.
    Valid arguments result from applying correct rules of reasoning.
    Examples of correct rules of reasoning include:
</p>

<ul>
   <li> <span class="math">A or not A.</span></li>
   <li> <span class="math">Not (A and not A).</span></li>
   <li> <span class="math">A. B. Therefore, A and B.</span></li>
   <li> <span class="math">A. Therefore, A or B.</span></li>
   <li> <span class="math">A and B. Therefore, A.</span></li>
   <li> <span class="math">A or B. Not A. Therefore, B.</span></li>
   <li> <span class="math">Not A. Therefore, not (A and B).</span></li>
   <li> <span class="math">Not (A and B). Therefore, (not A) or (not B).</span></li>
   <li> <span class="math">Not (A or B). Therefore, (not A) and (not B).</span></li>
   <li> <span class="math">If A then B. A. Therefore, B.</span></li>
   <li> <span class="math">If A then B. Not B. Therefore, not A.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>
    Using incorrect rules of reasoning or misapplying correct rules results in a
    <span class="termOfArt">formal fallacy</span>.
    There are many common formal fallacies.
    One is the <span class="termOfArt">non sequitur</span>.
    In a <span class="termOfArt">non sequitur</span>, a necessary premise is missing.
    If the missing premise relates one of the stated premises to a different premise (i.e., ties evidence given to
    evidence not given), the fallacy is a <span class="termOfArt">non sequitur of evidence</span>.
    If the missing premise relates a valid conclusion but unstated conclusion to the stated
    conclusion (i.e., ties the conclusion given to
    a conclusion not given), the fallacy is a <span class="termOfArt">non sequitur of relevance</span>.
    There are other formal fallacies as well.
    Examples of formal fallacies include:
</p>

<ul>
   <li> <span class="math">A or B. A.  Therefore, not B.</span></li>
   <li> <span class="math">Not (A and B). Not A. Therefore, B.</span></li>
   <li> <span class="math">If A then B. B.  Therefore, A.</span></li>
   <li> <span class="math">If A then B. not A.  Therefore, not B.</span></li>
   <li> <span class="math">If A then B. C.  Therefore, B.</span></li>
   <li> <span class="math">If A then B. A.  Therefore, C.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>
    In addition to formal fallacies, there are <span class="termOfArt">informal fallacies</span>.
    Although the categorization is not strict, informal fallacies generally fall into two groups:
    <span class="termOfArt">fallacies of relevance</span> and <span class="termOfArt">fallacies of evidence</span>.
    Fallacies of relevance have <span class="termOfArt">non sequiturs of relevance</span> at their core;
    fallacies of evidence have <span class="termOfArt">non sequiturs of evidence</span>.
    Examples of the former include <span class="termOfArt">ad hominem</span> and other genetic fallacies,
    appeals to emotion (fear, pity), the straw man, the red herring, and arguments that beg the question.
    Examples of the latter include appeals to authority, slippery slope, hasty generalizations,
    weak analogies, <span class="termOfArt">post hoc ergo propter hoc</span>, and
    <span class="termOfArt">cum hoc ergo propter hoc</span>.
    Equivocation can hide a fallacy of relevance or a fallacy of evidence.
    Inconsistency can produce a valid argument, but never a sound argument.
</p>

<p>
    Statistics can be (and often is) misused to produce both kinds of informal fallacy.
    Be alert to the structure of arguments to avoid being deceived and to avoid deception.
