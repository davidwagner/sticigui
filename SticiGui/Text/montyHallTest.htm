    examined two a priori arguments that
    the probability of winning the game by switching is 1/2, and two a priori
    arguments that the probability of winning by switching is 1/3.
</p>

<p>
    This chapter develops an empirical approach to resolving the issue using the
    observed number of wins in repeated play.
    Developing the approach leads to several key ideas:
    <em>box models</em>, <em>the Law of Large Numbers</em>,
    <em>probability histograms</em>, <em>the binomial distribution</em>,
    and <em>the maximum likelihood method</em> for deciding among competing models.
</p>


<h2><a id="introduction"></a>Introduction
</h2>

<p>
    This chapter uses the Let's Make a Deal problem to develop several ideas that are
    central to Statistics and Probability.
    We would like to know whether the chance of winning the game by switching is 1/2 or 2/3.
    The number of wins by switching in a fixed number of plays of the game is represented
    by a <em>box model</em>, a probabilistically equivalent problem involving drawing
    tickets at random from a box.
    If the chance of winning by switching is 1/2, the number of wins in 50 plays is like
    the <em>sample sum</em> of the numbers on the tickets in 50 random draws with
    replacement from a box that contains two tickets, one labeled &quot;1&quot; and one
    labeled &quot;0.&quot;
    If the chance of winning by switching is 2/3, the number of wins in 50 plays of the
    game is like the sample sum of the numbers on the tickets in 50 random draws with
    replacement from a box that contains three tickets, two labeled &quot;1&quot; and one
    labeled &quot;0.&quot;
    This leads us to study the <em>probability distribution</em> of the sample sum of draws with
    replacement from boxes of numbered tickets.
    For boxes that contain tickets labeled only with the numbers 0 and 1, we calculate the
    probability distribution of the sample sum explicitly using ideas from
<script language="JavaScript1.4" type="text/javascript"><!--
    document.writeln(citeLinkChapter('probabilityPhilosophy') + ', and ' +
                     citeLinkChapter('sets') + '. ');
// -->
</script>
    This distribution is called the <em>binomial distribution</em>.
    We decide whether the probability of winning by switching is 1/2 or 2/3 using
    <em>maximum likelihood</em>:  whichever hypothesis assigns larger probability to the
    observed data.
</p>

    A Box Model for the Let's Make a Deal Problem
</h2>

</p>

<p>
    Suppose that the chance of winning by switching really is 50%.
    Then if we play the game (independently) over and over, say 50 times, the number of
    times we win behaves like the number of heads in 50 tosses of a fair coin.
    Equivalently, it behaves like the number of tickets labeled &quot;1&quot; we get in 50
    random draws with replacement from a box of tickets containing one ticket labeled &quot;0&quot;
    and one ticket labeled &quot;1:&quot;
</p>

<div class="boxModel">
   <p class="boxLabel">
      Box 1
   </p>
   <div class="boxContents">
      <p class="boxTickets">0</p>
      <p class="boxTickets">1</p>
   </div>
</div>



<p>
    Getting the ticket labeled &quot;1&quot; in a given draw represents a win by switching
    in the corresponding play of the game; getting the ticket labeled &quot;0&quot; in a given
    draw represents a loss by switching in the corresponding play of the game.
</p>

<p>
    In contrast, if the chance of winning by switching is really 2/3 (66.67%), the number
    of times we win by switching in 50 independent plays of the game is like the number
    of tickets labeled &quot;1&quot; we get in 50 random draws with replacement from a box
    of tickets containing one ticket labeled &quot;0&quot; and two tickets labeled &quot;1:&quot;
</p>

<div class="boxModel">
   <p class="boxLabel">
      Box 2
   </p>
   <div class="boxContents">
      <p class="boxTickets">0</p>
      <p class="boxTickets">1</p>
      <p class="boxTickets">1</p>
   </div>
</div>

<p>
    We stir up the tickets in the box and draw a ticket without looking.
    We then record the number on the ticket drawn, replace the ticket,
    stir up the box again, and draw again, until we have drawn 50 times.
</p>

<p>
    These are examples of <em>box models</em>, in which an experiment is modeled by a
    probabilistically equivalent problem involving drawing tickets at random from a box.
    We call any box of numbered tickets for which the number on each ticket is 0 or 1 a
    <span class="termOfArt">0-1 box</span>.
    Box&nbsp;1 and Box&nbsp;2 are 0-1 boxes.
</p>

<p>
    We would expect about half of the draws from Box&nbsp;1 to result in the ticket labeled
    &quot;1;&quot; we would expect about 2/3 of the draws from Box&nbsp;2 to result in a ticket
    labeled &quot;1.&quot;
    We want to decide from the number of tickets labeled &quot;1&quot; we get in 50 draws
    whether winning by switching is like drawing at random from Box&nbsp;1 or like drawing
    at random from Box&nbsp;2.
    Fifty draws from either box could yield a ticket labeled &quot;1&quot; any number of
    times between 0 and 50, but the chances of these possibilities are different for
    the two boxes.
</p>

<p>
    Consider the following rule:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        If 29 or fewer tickets labeled &quot;1&quot; result from the 50 draws, conclude
        that the box is Box&nbsp;1.
    </li>
    <li>
        Otherwise, conclude that the box is Box&nbsp;2.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Any rule like this can err in two ways: It can lead us to conclude that the box is Box&nbsp;1
    when it is really Box&nbsp;2, and vice versa.
    (If the box is neither Box&nbsp;1 nor Box&nbsp;2, the rule always suggests the wrong conclusion.)
</p>

<p>
    Because we expect a larger number of tickets labeled &quot;1&quot; if we are drawing from
    Box&nbsp;2, it makes sense to conclude that the box is Box&nbsp;2 if sufficiently many
    of the draws give a ticket labeled &quot;1.&quot;
    How high should we set the threshold?
</p>

<p>
    In 50 repeated plays of the game, how does the number of wins by switching behave under
    the two hypotheses&mdash;that the chance of winning by switching is 50% and that the chance
    of winning by switching is 66.67%?
    Equivalently, how does the number of tickets labeled &quot;1&quot; in 50 independent
    draws with replacement from Box&nbsp;1 compare with the number of tickets labeled &quot;1&quot;
    in 50 independent draws with replacement from Box&nbsp;2?
</p>

<p>
    Notice that the number of tickets labeled &quot;1&quot; in <em>n</em> draws is just the
    sum of the numbers on the tickets drawn: Each ticket labeled &quot;1&quot; contributes
    1 to the sum; each ticket labeled &quot;0&quot; leaves the sum unchanged.
    That is, we get a ticket labeled &quot;1&quot; on exactly <em>k</em> of the <em>n</em>
    draws if and only if the sum of the numbers on the tickets we draw is <em>k</em>.
    The sum of the numbers on the tickets drawn at random is called the <em>sample sum</em>.
</p>

<p>
    The sample sum of 50 draws with replacement from Box&nbsp;1 or Box&nbsp;2 is not
    perfectly predictable:
    It depends on the luck of the draw.
    There is a calculable probability that the sample sum of 50 random draws with replacement
    from Box&nbsp;1 equals 0, that it equals 1,&nbsp;&hellip;&nbsp;, and that it equals 50.
    Those probabilities comprise <em>the sampling distribution of the sample sum for a random
    sample of size 50 with replacement</em> from Box&nbsp;1.

    The text area at the right of the tool shows the contents of the box of tickets:
    initially, two tickets, one labeled &quot;0&quot; and one labeled &quot;1,&quot; just
    as in Box&nbsp;1.
    We shall call this text area the &quot;population box&quot; to distinguish it from the
    other boxes in the figure that accept input.
    The number of tickets to draw with replacement is the sample size, which is given near
    the bottom of the figure, and is set to 50 initially.
    Every time you click <span class="appCtrlName">Take Sample</span>, the computer draws 50 tickets with
    replacement from the population box, computes their sample sum, and updates a histogram
    in the middle of the figure.
    The histogram displays the frequency distribution of the values of the sample sum so far.
    Click <span class="appCtrlName">Take Sample</span> a few times.
    You will see the distribution of the sample sum of 50 draws from Box&nbsp;1 evolve.
</p>

<p>
    The numbers at the left of
<script language="JavaScript1.4" type="text/javascript"><!--
    citeFig(figCtr-1);

</script>
    are properties of the numbers in the population box and the sample values.
    Starting from the bottom,
    <span class="appCtrlName">Samples</span> is the number of samples of size 50
    that have been drawn from the population
    box&mdash;the number of values of the sample sum displayed in the histogram.
    <span class="appCtrlName">SD(values)</span>
     is the <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#sd">standard deviation</a> of the Samples observed
    values of the sample sum.

     is the <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#mean">mean</a> of the Samples observed values
    of the sample sum.
    <span class="appCtrlName">SE(sum)</span>
    is the <em>standard error</em> of the sample sum of 50 random draws with
    replacement from the population box; standard error is introduced in
<script language="JavaScript1.4" type="text/javascript"><!--
    document.writeln(citeLinkChapter('standardError') + '. ');
// -->
</script>
    The standard error of the sample sum is a measure of how scattered the values of the
    sample sum tend to be in repeated experiments.
    <span class="appCtrlName">E(sum)</span>
     is the <em>expected value</em> of the sample sum; expected value is introduced in
<script language="JavaScript1.4" type="text/javascript"><!--
    document.writeln(citeLinkChapter('expectation') + '. ');
// -->
</script>
    The expected value of the sample sum is the long-run average value of the sample sum in
    repeated experiments.
    <span class="appCtrlName">SD(box)</span>
    is the <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#sd">standard deviation</a> of the list of numbers on
    the tickets in the population box.
    The population box initially contains one ticket labeled &quot;1&quot; and one ticket
    labeled &quot;0.&quot;
    The mean of these two values is (0&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)/2&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.5, so the SD of the
    list is
</p>

<p class="math">
    SD(box)&nbsp;=&nbsp;( ((0-0.5)<sup>2</sup> +
    (1 - 0.5)<sup>2</sup>)/2 )<sup>&frac12;</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.5.
</p>

<p>
    <span class="appCtrlName">Ave(box)</span>
    is the mean of the numbers on the tickets in the population box, which is 0.5
    initially.
</p>

<p>
    Change the number of samples to take (in <span class="appCtrlName">Take__________samples</span>) from
    1 to 1000.
    This will speed things up: Every time you click <span class="appCtrlName">Take Sample</span>, the computer will
    draw 50 tickets with replacement from the population Box&nbsp;1000 times, and include the
    1000 new values of the sample sum in the histogram.
    Click <span class="appCtrlName">Take Sample</span> a few times.
    Note that the histogram of the sample sum changes rapidly at first, then stabilizes:
    Once you have taken a few thousand samples, the shape of the histogram does not change
    much when you draw even more samples of size 50.
    (
<script language="JavaScript1.4" type="text/javascript"><!--
    citeFig(figCtr-1);
// -->
</script>
    will not allow you to take more than 10,000 samples of size 50.)
    The distribution is centered at 25: on the average, in 50 draws with replacement from
    Box&nbsp;1, one gets 25 tickets labeled &quot;1.&quot;
    However, the entire range of values between 0 and 50 is possible, and a range of about
    15 values around 25 occurs fairly frequently.
</p>

<div class="indent">
<p class="inline">
    Now delete the contents of the population box on the right and replace them with
    0, 1, 1, so that the population box is like Box&nbsp;2 instead of Box&nbsp;1.
    Click <span class="appCtrlName">Take Sample</span> a few times, leaving
    <span class="appCtrlName">Take_________samples</span>
    set to 1000.
    The histogram of the observed values of the sample sum stabilizes to a different shape
    than it had for draws from Box&nbsp;1.
    This histogram is centered near 50&times;2/3=33.33.
    That the shape of the histogram stabilizes as the number of samples of size 50 grows
    illustrates <em>the Law of Large Numbers</em>, which states that the relative
    frequency with which an event occurs in repeated, independent trials is increasingly
    likely to be close to the probability of the event.

<p>
    The sample sum of 50 random draws with replacement from Box&nbsp;1 is a special case of
    the sample sum of <em>n</em> random draws with replacement from a box of tickets of which a
    fraction <em>p</em> are labeled &quot;1&quot; and the rest are labeled &quot;0.&quot;
    The probability distribution of such a sample sum has a name: the binomial distribution
    with parameters <em>n</em> and <em>p</em>.
    For <em>k</em>=0, 1, 2, &hellip;&nbsp;, <em>n</em>,  the binomial distribution with
    parameters <em>n</em> and <em>p</em> gives the chance that the sample sum equals <em>k</em>.
    The probability distribution of the sample sum of 50 random draws with
    replacement from Box&nbsp;1 has a binomial distribution with parameters
    <em>n</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;50 and <em>p</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;50%.
    Let us figure out what that distribution is.
</p>

<p>
    The sample sum of 50 draws with replacement from Box&nbsp;1 equals <em>k</em> if we
    draw <em>k</em> tickets labeled
    &quot;1&quot; and (50-<em>k</em>) tickets labeled &quot;0.&quot;
    How many ways can that occur?
    There are <sub>50</sub>C<sub><em>k</em></sub> ways to specify <em>k</em> of 50
    draws to be the draws that give tickets labeled &quot;1.&quot;
    We can find the total chance of getting &quot;1&quot; on <em>k</em> of the
    draws by adding the chances of getting <em>k</em> &quot;1&quot;s each of
    those <sub>50</sub>C<sub><em>k</em></sub> possible ways, because
    those ways are <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#disjoint">mutually exclusive</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Consider one particular way to get <em>k</em> &quot;1&quot;s: the
    first <em>k</em> draws give the ticket labeled &quot;1,&quot; and the rest give the
    ticket labeled &quot;0.&quot;
    Because the draws are independent, the chance of
</p>

<p>
    &quot;1&quot; on the first draw and &quot;1&quot; on the second draw and  &hellip;
    and &quot;1&quot; on the <em>k</em><sup>th</sup> draw and &quot;0&quot; on the
    <em>k</em>+1<sup>st</sup> draw and &quot;0&quot; on the
    <em>k</em>+2<sup>nd</sup> draw and &hellip; and &quot;0&quot; on
    the 50<sup>th</sup> draw
</p>

<p>
    is the product of the chance of getting &quot;1&quot; on the first draw, the
    chance of getting &quot;1&quot; on the second draw, &hellip;
    and the chance of getting &quot;0&quot; on the 50<sup>th</sup> draw, namely
</p>

<p class="math">
    (chance of getting &quot;1&quot;)<sup><em>k</em></sup> &times;
    (chance of getting &quot;0&quot;)<sup>50-<em>k</em></sup> =
    (50%)<sup><em>k</em></sup> &times; (50%)<sup>50-<em>k</em></sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;(50%)<sup>50</sup>.
</p>

<p>
    The chance of getting &quot;1&quot; <em>k</em> times and &quot;0&quot; 50-<em>k</em>
    times in any other order is the same: Because the draws are
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#independent">independent</a>, we would get the same
    factors in a different order.
    The product does not depend on the order of the factors
    (multiplication is commutative), so the product would still be (50%)<sup>50</sup>.
</p>

<p>
    Thus the chance of getting &quot;1&quot; <em>k</em> times and &quot;0&quot; 50-<em>k</em> times is
</p>

<p class="math">
        <sub>50</sub>C<sub><em>k</em></sub>(50%)<sup>50</sup>.
</p>

<p>
        By similar reasoning, if we were drawing from Box&nbsp;2, the chance of getting
        &quot;1&quot; <em>k</em> times and &quot;0&quot;
        50-<em>k</em> times in any particular order would be
        (2/3)<sup>k</sup>(1/3)<sup>50-<em>k</em></sup>,
        and because there are <sub>50</sub>C<sub><em>k</em></sub>
        possible orders for the <em>k</em> &quot;1&quot;s, the overall chance of getting
        <em>k</em> tickets labeled &quot;1&quot; (the chance that the
        <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#sample_sum">sample sum</a> is <em>k</em>) is
</p>

<p class="math">

<h3>
   <a id="binomial_n_and_p"></a>Dependence of the Binomial
  Distribution on <em>n</em> and <em>p</em>
</h3>

<p>
    How does the binomial distribution depend on <em>n</em> and <em>p</em>?
    The larger the number of trials <em>n</em>, the wider the range of
    possible outcomes: The range of possible outcomes is from zero to <em>n</em>
    (one cannot draw fewer than 0 tickets labeled &quot;1,&quot; nor more than <em>n</em> tickets
    labeled &quot;1&quot; in <em>n</em> draws).
    If the fraction <em>p</em> of tickets labeled &quot;1&quot;
    in the box is zero, all the draws must result in a ticket labeled &quot;0,&quot;
    so the chance that the sample sum is zero equals 100%, and the chance of any
    other value is zero.
    If <em>p</em> is small, the number of times a ticket labeled &quot;1&quot; is drawn is likely
    to be small, so the distribution is skewed to the right (most of the probability is
    at the left end of the histogram, with a long, thin right tail).
</p>

<p>
    If <em>p</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;50%, the chances of drawing a ticket labeled
    &quot;0&quot; and of drawing a ticket
    labeled &quot;1&quot; are the same in every trial.
    The chance the sample sum is <em>k</em> thus must equal the chance that the sample
    sum is <em>n</em>-<em>k</em>, so the probability histogram must be symmetrical.
</p>

<p>
    If <em>p</em> is very large (close to 100%), it is likely that a large proportion of
    the draws will yield a ticket labeled &quot;1,&quot; so the probability histogram
    will be skewed to the left.
    If <em>p</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;100%, all the tickets are labeled &quot;1,&quot; so the
    chance that the sample sum is <em>n</em> is
    100%, and the chance of any other value is zero.
</p>

<p>
    The probability histogram is most spread out when <em>p</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;50%.
    When <em>p</em> is larger or smaller, the probability tends to be more concentrated in a
    smaller range of values, becoming increasingly concentrated as <em>p</em> approaches 0% or 100%
    (then the probability becomes completely concentrated at 0 or <em>n</em>, respectively).
</p>

<p>
    Experiment for yourself using
<script language="JavaScript1.4" type="text/javascript"><!--
    citeFig(figCtr-1);
// -->
</script>:
    Change the value of <em>n</em> to 5, 20, 50, and 100, and change the value of
    <em>p</em> to 1%, 10%, 50%, 90%, and 99%.
    Note how the shape of the binomial probability histogram varies.

</p>

<h3>
   <a id="binomial_not_appropriate"></a>When the Binomial
    Distribution Does <em>not</em> Apply
</h3>

<p>
    We can identify drawing a ticket labeled &quot;1&quot; with &quot;success,&quot;
    and drawing a ticket labeled &quot;0&quot; with &quot;failure.&quot;
    In repeated independent draws with replacement, the number of tickets labeled
    &quot;1&quot; drawn from the box in <em>n</em> draws (the sample sum of <em>n</em> draws) can be
    thought of as the number of &quot;successes&quot; in <em>n</em> independent trials that each
    have the same probability <em>p</em> of success (<em>p</em> is the proportion of tickets
    in the box labeled &quot;1,&quot; which does not change from draw to draw if the
    tickets are replaced).
    If a quantity is not equivalent to the sample sum of <em>n</em> independent draws
    with replacement from a box of tickets of which a proportion <em>p</em> are labeled
    &quot;1&quot; and the rest are labeled &quot;0,&quot; the quantity does not have a
    binomial distribution.
</p>

<p>
    If the box contains tickets labeled with numbers other than 0 and 1,
    the sample sum does not have a binomial distribution.
    If the number <em>n</em> of draws is not fixed in advance, the sample sum
    does not have a binomial distribution.
    If the draws are not independent, the sample sum does not
    have a binomial distribution.
    If the chance of drawing a ticket labeled &quot;1&quot; is not the same
    value <em>p</em> in each draw, the sample sum does not have a binomial distribution.
</p>

<p>
    For example, suppose we draw from a box that contains five tickets in it:
    three with &quot;0&quot; written on them and two with &quot;1&quot; written on them.
    If we stir up the tickets in the box and draw one at random, the chance
    that it says &quot;1&quot; is 40% (2/5).
    If we draw five times in succession, with replacement and stirring the tickets
    thoroughly between draws, the number of times we get a ticket labeled "1"
    has a binomial distribution with parameters <em>n</em>=5 and <em>p</em>=40%.
    If we do not stir the tickets up between draws, we're more likely to
    draw the same ticket over and over (it stays on top): The draws are not
    independent, so the binomial distribution does not apply.
    Similarly, if we do not replace the tickets between draws, the draws are
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#dependent">dependent</a>, and the probability of drawing
    a ticket labeled &quot;1&quot; is not
    constant from trial to trial, so the binomial distribution does not apply.
</p>

<p>
    The binomial distribution does not apply if the number of draws is not
    fixed in advance.
    For example, suppose we draw with replacement from the box just described,
    mixing the tickets thoroughly between draws, and continue drawing until we
    see &quot;1&quot; twice in a row.
    Then the number of draws is random, not fixed, and the sample sum of the draws
    does not have a binomial distribution.

    Using the Binomial Distribution
</h3>

<p>
  The following examples hint at the range of problems that can be solved
  using the binomial distribution.
</p>

<div class="example">

<script language="JavaScript1.4" type="text/javascript"><!--
    var qStr = 'Sampling from Box&nbsp;2.';
    writeExampleCaption(qStr);
// -->
</script>

<p>
    What is the chance that the sum of 50 independent draws with replacement from Box&nbsp;2 is at
    least 35 and no larger than 40?
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Solution</strong>.
    We break the event into mutually exclusive outcomes whose chances we know how to compute.
    For the sample sum to be at least 35 and no larger than 40 means that the sample sum is
    35, 36, 37, 38, 39, or 40.
</p>

<p>
    The chance that the sample sum is 35 is
    <sub>50</sub>C<sub>35</sub>(2/3)<sup>35</sup>(1/3)<sup>15</sup>.
    The chance that the sample sum is 36 is
    <sub>50</sub>C<sub>36</sub>(2/3)<sup>36</sup>(1/3)<sup>14</sup>, etc.
    Adding these 6 numbers together gives the chance that the sample sum is at least 35
    and no larger than 40.
</p>

<p>
    Alternatively, we can read the chance from
<script language="JavaScript1.4" type="text/javascript"><!--
    citeFig(figCtr-1);
// -->
</script>
    by highlighting the range of bins centered at 35 to 40.
    That range is from 34.5 to 40.5; the tool shows that the area from 34.5 to 40.5
    of the binomial probability histogram for <em>n</em>=50 draws and a proportion <em>p</em>=2/3
    of tickets labeled &quot;1&quot; is 35.6%.

    var qStr = 'Sample Sum of Draws from a Box with Tickets Labeled 0, 1, and 2.';

</script>

<p>
  A box contains 3 tickets.
  One of the tickets is labeled &quot;0,&quot; one is labeled &quot;1,&quot; and&nbsp;
  1 is labeled &quot;2.&quot;
  What is the chance that the sample sum of two draws with replacement from the box is 2?
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Solution</strong>: Because the tickets are labeled with
    numbers other than just &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1,&quot; the sample sum does not have a
    binomial distribution.
    However, we can still find the chance using the kind of reasoning that led to the binomial
    distribution.
</p>
<p>
    How can the sample sum of two draws with replacement from this box equal 2?
    There are three mutually exclusive ways:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Draw the ticket labeled &quot;1&quot; in both draws.
    </li>
    <li>Draw the ticket labeled &quot;0&quot; on the first draw and the
          ticket labeled &quot;2&quot; on the second draw.
    </li>
    <li>Draw the ticket labeled &quot;2&quot; on the first draw and the
          ticket labeled &quot;0&quot; on the second draw.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Because the draws are independent and the chance of getting each of
  the three tickets is the same (1/3), the chance of each of these mutually exclusive ways
  that the sample sum can equal 2 is (1/3)(1/3)=1/9.
  That is, the chance of getting the
  ticket labeled &quot;1&quot; on the first and second draws is (1/3)(1/3); the chance of
  getting the ticket labeled &quot;0&quot; on the first draw and the ticket labeled
  &quot;2&quot; on the second draw is (1/3)(1/3); and the chance of getting the ticket
  labeled &quot;2&quot; on the first draw and the ticket labeled &quot;0&quot; on the second
  draw is (1/3)(1/3).
  The overall chance that the sample sum of two draws with replacement
  from this box is 2 is thus 1/9+1/9+1/9&nbsp;=&nbsp;1/3.

    What is the chance that the sample sum of numbers on the tickets is 2?

  <strong>Solution</strong>: In

  we shall solve problems like this one.

    A box of tickets contains three tickets labeled &quot;-1&quot; and seven tickets
    labeled &quot;5.&quot;
    What is the chance that the sample sum of 5 independent random draws with
    replacement from this box is 7?
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Solution</strong>: Because the labels on the tickets are not just &quot;0&quot;
    and &quot;1,&quot; we cannot use the binomial distribution directly.
    However, we can transform the problem to one in which the binomial distribution
    can be used. Suppose we added 1 to the label of each ticket in the box.
    Then the labels on the tickets would be &quot;0&quot; and &quot;6.&quot;
    That would add 5 to the sample sum of 5 draws, because no matter which ticket we got,
    it would contribute 1 more than its counterpart in the original problem.
    Suppose we divided the labels on the tickets in this new box by 6.
    That would divide the sample sum by six, for the same reason.
    However, now the transformed labels are &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1.&quot;
    The sample sum of 5 draws from the original box equals 7 if and only if the sample sum of the
    relabeled tickets equals (7+5)/6&nbsp;=&nbsp;2.
    For the sample sum of 5 draws from the original box to equal 7,
    we need to get the ticket labeled &quot;5&quot; twice, and the ticket labeled
    &quot;-1&quot; thrice.
    The chance of this occurring is

    A box contains five tickets, labeled &quot;1,&quot; &quot;2,&quot; &quot;3,&quot;
    &quot;4,&quot; and &quot;5.&quot;
    Ten tickets will be drawn at random with replacement from the box.
    What is the chance that more than 2 and fewer than 6 of the draws give tickets with
    even numbers on them?
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Solution</strong>: The number of even-numbered tickets
  in 10 independent draws from this box is like the number of tickets labeled &quot;1&quot;
  in 10 draws from a box of tickets containing two tickets labeled &quot;1&quot; and three
  tickets labeled &quot;0.&quot;
  Drawing a ticket labeled &quot;1&quot; from this box has the same chance as drawing a ticket
  labeled with an even number from the original box (2/5&nbsp;=&nbsp;40%), and drawing a
  ticket labeled &quot;0&quot; from this box has the same chance as
  drawing a ticket labeled with an odd number from the original box (3/5&nbsp;=&nbsp;60%).
  Thus the number of even-numbered tickets in 10 independent draws from the original box has a
  binomial distribution with <em>n</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;10 and <em>p</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;40%.
  The chance of drawing more than 2 and fewer than 6 even numbers is the chance of drawing
  3, 4, or 5 even numbers, which is

  A quarter, a dime, and a nickel are tossed together 10 times.
  Suppose that the coins are fair, so that the chance of &quot;heads&quot; on each coin is
  50%, and suppose that the tosses are all independent.
</p>

    <li>
       What is the chance that in every toss, at least two of the coins show the same face
       (at least two heads or at least two tails)?

    <li>
        What is the chance that all three coins land showing the same face in at least 5 of
        the ten tosses?
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
  <strong>Solution</strong>.
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        The chance is 100%.
        In every toss, at least two of the three coins <em>must</em> show the same face.
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
        The chance that all three coins land showing the same face in a given toss can be
        broken into two <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#disjoint">mutually exclusive</a> events:
        All three coins show heads, and all three coins show tails.
        Because the tosses are independent, the chance that all three coins show heads
        on a given toss is (1/2)(1/2)(1/2)&nbsp;=&nbsp;1/8.
        This is also the chance that all three coins show tails on a given toss.
        The chance that all three coins show the same face on a given toss is thus
        1/8+1/8&nbsp;=&nbsp;1/4.
        The number of times the three coins show the same face in 10 tosses is like the
        sample sum of 10 independent random draws with replacement from a box that contains
        three tickets labeled &quot;0&quot; and one ticket labeled &quot;1:&quot;

    We now know that the distribution of the sample sum of 50 random draws with replacement
    from Box&nbsp;1 has a binomial distribution with parameters <em>n</em>=50 and
    <em>p</em>=50%, and that the distribution
    of the sample sum of 50 random draws with replacement from Box&nbsp;2 has a binomial
    distribution with parameters <em>n</em>=50 and <em>p</em>=66.67%.
    These two distributions are quite different: The sample sum is likely to be much larger
    if we are drawing from Box&nbsp;2.
    Armed with the binomial distribution, we can analyze the proposed rule for deciding
    whether switching improves one's chance of winning the Let's Make a Deal problem:
    conclude switching helps if the number of wins by switching in 50 plays is greater
    than or equal to 30;
    otherwise, conclude switching does not help.

    Continuation of the &quot;Let's Make a Deal&quot; Problem
</h2>

<p>
    The chance of drawing <em>k</em> tickets labeled &quot;1&quot;
    from Box&nbsp;1 or Box&nbsp;2 is given by a binomial
    distribution with appropriate values of the parameters <em>n</em> and <em>p</em>.
    How can we use this fact to decide which box we are drawing from (how shall we infer
    whether the chance of winning by switching is 1/2  or 2/3)?
    There are many ways to proceed.
    In

    we shall take a
    different approach, called a &quot;statistical hypothesis test&quot; or a
    &quot;test of significance.&quot;
    Here we shall do something similar but simpler.
</p>

<p>
    I am going to draw 10 tickets at random with replacement from a box of tickets.
    I do not know exactly what the box contains, but I do know that either it contains one ticket
    labeled &quot;0&quot; and one ticket labeled &quot;1,&quot; or it contains one
    ticket labeled &quot;0&quot; and one
    ticket labeled &quot;5.&quot;
    That is, either I shall draw from Box&nbsp;3 or from Box&nbsp;4 below, but I  do not know which.
    From the labels on the tickets I draw, I want to conclude whether the box is Box&nbsp;3
    or Box&nbsp;4.
    Before I draw the tickets, I want to choose a rule for deciding between the hypothesis
    that the box is Box&nbsp;3 and the competing hypothesis that the box is Box&nbsp;4.
    The rule will say, for each possible collection of 10 tickets that might be drawn,
    whether to conclude the box is Box&nbsp;3 or Box&nbsp;4.

<p>
    If I draw even one ticket labeled &quot;1,&quot; I must be drawing from Box&nbsp;3, so I should conclude
    I am drawing from Box&nbsp;3.
    Similarly, if I get even one ticket labeled &quot;5,&quot; I must be drawing from Box&nbsp;4, so I should
    conclude I am drawing from Box&nbsp;4.
    In either case, my conclusion is that I am drawing from the box for which it is more
    likely to observe what I do observe.
    If I get only tickets labeled &quot;0,&quot; the data do not tell me anything about which box I am
    drawing from, so I might as well toss a coin to make the decision.
</p>

<p>
    Now suppose the two possible boxes are Box&nbsp;5 and Box&nbsp;6 below,
    instead of Box&nbsp;3 and Box&nbsp;4.
    Again, I shall draw 10 tickets at random with replacement, but this time I will compute
    the sample sum of the draws.
    I want to use the value of the sample sum to draw a conclusion about whether the box is
    Box&nbsp;5 or Box&nbsp;6.

<p>
    Whether the box is Box&nbsp;5 or Box&nbsp;6, the sample sum of 10 independent random draws could be
    0, 1, 2,  &hellip;&nbsp;, or 10.
    However, if the sample sum turns out to be 9, it is much more plausible that the box is
    Box&nbsp;5 than that it is Box&nbsp;6, because the chance that the sample sum is 9 is much larger
    if the box is Box&nbsp;5 than if it is Box&nbsp;6.
    It would be reasonable to decide that if the sample sum turns out to be 9, the box is Box&nbsp;5.
    Similarly, if the sample sum turns out to be 1, it is much more plausible that the box is
    Box&nbsp;6 than that it is Box&nbsp;5, because the chance that the sample sum is 1 is much larger
    if the box is Box&nbsp;6 than if the box is Box&nbsp;5.
    It would be reasonable to decide that if the sample sum turns out to be 1, I am drawing
    from Box&nbsp;6.

    This thought experiment suggests the following decision rule for the "Let's Make a Deal"
    problem: Suppose that the sample sum of 50 random draws with replacement from the box turns
    out to be <em>k</em>.
    If the probability that the sample sum of 50 random draws with replacement from Box&nbsp;1 is
    <em>k</em> is larger than the probability that the sample sum of 50 random draws with replacement
    from Box&nbsp;2 is <em>k</em>, conclude that the box is  Box&nbsp;1.
    Conversely, if the probability that the sample sum of 50 random draws with replacement
    from Box&nbsp;2 is <em>k</em> is larger than the probability that the sample sum of 50 random draws

    conclude that the box is  Box&nbsp;1; if the ratio is less than one, conclude that the
    box is Box&nbsp;2.
    (If the ratio equals 1 exactly, we could toss a coin to make the decision.)
</p>

<p>
    Let's look at the ratio between the chance that the sample sum is <em>k</em> if the box is
    Box&nbsp;1 and the chance that the sample sum is <em>k</em> if the box is Box&nbsp;2:

<p>
    The numerator is a number greater than 1, and the denominator grows with <em>k</em>, so the ratio
    decreases with <em>k</em>.
    The ratio is largest for <em>k</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, when it is
    (3/2)<sup>50</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;6.38&times;10<sup>8</sup>, and is smallest for <em>k</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;50,
    when it is (3/4)<sup>50</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;5.66&times;10<sup>-7</sup>.
    For small values of <em>k</em> the ratio is larger than 1 and for large values of <em>k</em> it is less
    than 1.
    It crosses 1 at 50(log<sub>2</sub>(3) - 1)&nbsp;=&nbsp;29.24.
    That is, for <em>k</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, 1, 2,  &hellip;&nbsp;, 29, the chance that the sample sum is
    <em>k</em> is larger if the box is Box&nbsp;1 than if the box is Box&nbsp;2, and for
    <em>k</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;30, 31,  &hellip;&nbsp;, 50, the chance that the sample sum is <em>k</em> is larger
    if the box is Box&nbsp;2 than if the box is Box&nbsp;1.

<p>
    Verify that this is correct by using
<script language="JavaScript1.4" type="text/javascript"><!--

    to calculate the probabilities
    that the sample sum is 28, 29, and 30 for a binomial distribution with <em>n</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;50 and
    <em>p</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;50%, and for a binomial distribution with <em>n</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;50 and
    <em>p</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;66.67%.
    Begin by making sure that <span class="appCtrlName"><em>n</em></span> is set to 50.
    Set <span class="appCtrlName">Area from</span> to 27.5
    (either by deleting the number in the textbox and
    typing in 27.5, or by using the scrollbar), and set <span class="appCtrlName">to</span>
    to 28.5.
    The probability histogram bin centered at 28 should be the only yellow bin.
    Set <span class="appCtrlName">p(%)</span> to 50 and note
    <span class="appCtrlName">selected area</span>; it should be 7.9%.
    Reset <span class="appCtrlName">p(%)</span> to 66.67 and note
    <span class="appCtrlName">selected area</span>; it should be 3.3%.
    This shows that the probability that the sample sum of 50 random draws with replacement
    from Box&nbsp;1 equals 28 is 7.9%, while the probability that the sample sum of 50 draws
    with replacement from Box&nbsp;2 equals 28 is only 3.3%.
</p>

<p>
    Set <span class="appCtrlName">p(%)</span> back to 50.
    Set <span class="appCtrlName">Area from</span> text box to 28.5 and the
    to text box to 29.5 to highlight just the
    bin centered at 29.
    <span class="appCtrlName">Selected area</span> should be 6%.
    Change <span class="appCtrlName">p(%)</span> to 66.67; <span class="appCtrlName">selected area</span>
    should be 5%:
    The probability that the sample sum of 50 random draws with replacement from Box&nbsp;1
    equals 29 is 6%, and the probability that the sample sum of 50 random draws with
    replacement from Box&nbsp;2 equals 28 is 5%.
</p>

<p>
    Highlight the bin centered at 30 and repeat the two calculations.
    You should find that the probability that the sample sum of 50 random draws with
    replacement from Box&nbsp;1 equals 30 is 4.2%, and the probability that the sample
    sum of 50 random draws with replacement from Box&nbsp;2 equals 30 is 7%.
</p>

<p>
    A reasonable rule for deciding whether the box is Box&nbsp;1 or Box&nbsp;2 is to conclude
    that the box is the box for which the observed result is more likely.
    That is, we might reasonably adopt the decision rule &quot;conclude we are drawing from
    Box&nbsp;1 if the sample sum is less than 30; conclude we are drawing from Box&nbsp;2 if
    the sample sum is 30 or more.&quot;
</p>

<p>
    That rule will sometimes lead to the wrong conclusion: whether we are drawing from
    Box&nbsp;1 or from Box&nbsp;2, the sample sum is random and has possible values
    0, 1, 2, &hellip;&nbsp;, 50, so there is a chance that if the box is Box&nbsp;1,
    the sample sum will be 30 or more, and we will conclude erroneously that the
    box is Box&nbsp;2.
    Similarly, if the box is Box&nbsp;2, there is a chance that the sample sum will be 29 or
    less, and we will conclude erroneously that the box is Box&nbsp;1.
</p>

<p>
    What are those chances?
    We can find them using the binomial probability histogram.
    The chance we incorrectly conclude that the box is Box&nbsp;2 when the box is in
    fact Box&nbsp;1 is the chance that the sample sum is 30 or more if the box is Box&nbsp;1.
<script language="JavaScript1.4" type="text/javascript"><!--

    shows that the area of the binomial probability histogram with <em>n</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;50
    and <em>p</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;50% between 29.5 and 50.5 is 10.1%:
</p>

<div class="figure">
<script language="JavaScript1.4" type="text/javascript"><!--

<p>
  Conversely, the chance we incorrectly conclude that we are
  drawing from Box&nbsp;1 when we are really drawing from Box&nbsp;2 is the chance that the sample sum
  is 29 or less if we are drawing from Box&nbsp;2.
  That is the area of the binomial probability
  histogram with <em>n</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;50 and <em>p</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;66.67%, from -0.5 to 29.5,
  which is 12.6%, as shown in

<p>
    The chance we err using this approach is thus at most 12.6%, if the only possibilities
    are that we are drawing from Box&nbsp;1 or Box&nbsp;2.
    Of course, if the probability of winning by switching is neither 1/2 nor 2/3,
    this rule can never give the right conclusion, so it is not a substitute for the
    kind of reasoning we explored in

<p>
    Now let's apply this rule to try to determine empirically whether switching is a
    better strategy than sticking with the original guess.

<p>
    The rule we have explored in this chapter&mdash;pick the model for which the probability
    of the data is larger&mdash;generalizes to situations where there are more than two models,
    even an infinite number of models.
    In the general case, it is called <em>maximum likelihood</em>.
    The <em>likelihood</em> of a model is the probability that the experiment
    would result in the observed data if that model is true.
    The maximum likelihood method picks the model for which the likelihood is largest.
</p>


<h2>
    <a id="summary"></a>Summary
</h2>

<p>
    Some experiments can be modeled as drawing tickets at random from a box of numbered
    tickets.
    This analogy is called a <em>box model</em>.
    For example, a box model for the number of times a fair coin lands heads in 10 independent
    tosses is the <em>sample sum</em> of the numbers on the tickets in 10 random draws with
    replacement from a box that contains one ticket labeled &quot;1&quot; and one
    ticket labeled &quot;0.&quot;
</p>

<p>
    If one repeats an experiment over and over again, independently, the
    <em>Law of Large Numbers</em> says that the fraction of times each possible
    outcome occurs is increasingly likely to be close to the probability of the outcome.
    Thus if an experiment has numerical outcomes, the histogram of outcomes in repeated
    experiments will tend to stabilize, getting ever closer to the
    <em>probability histogram</em> of the experiment.
    The area of each bin in a probability histogram is the probability that the outcome
    is in the bin, much as the area of each bin in a histogram is the relative frequency
    of data in the bin.
</p>

<p>
    In repeated trials the sample sum of <span class="math">n</span> random draws with replacement from a box of
    tickets of which a fraction <span class="math">p</span> are labeled &quot;1&quot; and a fraction <span class="math">(1 &minus; p)</span> are
    labeled &quot;0&quot; has a <em>binomial probability distribution</em> with parameters <span class="math">n</span>
    and <span class="math">p</span>.
    For such an experiment, the chance that the sample sum equals <span class="math">k</span> is
</p>

<p class="math">
    <sub><em>n</em></sub>C<sub><em>k</em></sub>&times;<em>p</em><sup><em>k</em></sup> &times;
    (1-<em>p</em>)<sup><em>n</em>-<em>k</em></sup>,
    for <em>k</em>=0, 1, 2, &hellip;&nbsp;, <em>n</em>.
</p>

<p>
    If the number <span class="math">n</span> of draws is not fixed in advance, if the draws are not independent,
    if the fraction <span class="math">p</span> of tickets in the box labeled &quot;1&quot; varies for different draws,
    or if the box contains tickets with labels other than &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1,&quot;
    the sample sum does not have a binomial distribution.
</p>

<p>
    Some scientific questions can be posed as
    decisions among competing box models for a phenomenon.
    One way to use data to decide among models is to conclude that the model that
    explains the data best&mdash;that is, the model for which the probability of the observed
    data would be highest&mdash;is correct.
    This is called <em>maximum likelihood</em>.
    Maximum likelihood generally is fallible: There is a chance that it will come
    to the wrong conclusion; that chance depends on which of the models is correct.
    If none of the models is correct, it always reaches the wrong conclusion.
