    The Long Run and the Expected Value

<p>
    Random experiments and random variables have long-term regularities.
    The <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#law_of_large_numbers">Law of Large Numbers</a>
    says that in repeated <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#independent">independent</a> trials,
    the relative frequency
    of each outcome of a random experiment tends to approach the
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#probability">probability</a> of that outcome.
    That implies that the long-term average value of a
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#discrete">discrete</a>
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#random_variable">random variable</a>
    in repeated experiments tends to approach a limit, called the <em>expected value</em>
    of the random variable.
</p>

<p>
    The expected value of a random variable depends only on the
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#prob_distribution">probability distribution</a> of the random variable.
    The expected value has properties that can be exploited to find the expected
    value of some complicated random variables in terms of simpler ones.
    These properties allow us to find the expected value of the
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#sample_sum">sample sum</a> and
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#sample_mean">sample mean</a>
    of random draws with and without replacement from a box of numbered tickets.
    Special cases include the expected values of random variables with
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#binomial">binomial</a>
    and <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#hypergeometric">hypergeometric</a> distributions.
    We also find the expected values of random variables with
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#geometric">geometric</a> and
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#negative_binomial">negative binomial</a> distributions.

    The Law of Large Numbers says that the probability distribution of the
    fraction of successes in repeated independent trials with the same
    probability <span class="math">p</span> of success gets more and more concentrated near
    <span class="math">p</span> as the number of trials increases.
    As the number of trials increases, the chance that a given range of
    values around <span class="math">p</span> contains the fraction of successes increases.
    Conversely, as the number of trials increases, narrower and narrower
    intervals around <span class="math">p</span> have the same chance of containing the
    observed fraction of successes.

<h3><a id="lln_implications"></a>
    Implications of the Law of Large Numbers
</h3>

<p>
    In games of chance, you should not expect the number of times you win to
    approach (the number of times you play)&times;(the chance of winning in each game).
    However, you should expect the fraction of times you win to approach the
    chance of winning each game.
    There is no such thing as &quot;odds pressure&quot; tending to make winning more
    likely after a losing streak.
    Rather, a string of losses tends to be &quot;diluted&quot; over a
    larger and larger number of trials.
    Once you get behind, you are not likely to catch up in absolute
    terms (i.e., to reduce your losses).
    You are only likely to reduce your average loss per play of the game.
    Your losses can continue to mount even as the average loss per play shrinks.
    In fact, once you are behind by much, that is what tends to happen.
</p>

<p>
    As a thought experiment, suppose we agree to play a coin-tossing
    game in which if the coin lands heads, you pay me $1, and
    if the coin lands tails, I pay you $1.
    If I asked for an advantage of 25 tosses (i.e., starting $25 ahead),
    I doubt you would agree to play.
</p>

<p>
    On the other hand, suppose that we played this game, starting even
    (without the advantage I asked for), and that in the course of
    play, by chance I developed a lead of $25.
    Would you feel that the coin now &quot;owes&quot; you 25 tails?
    Can the coin tell the difference between an advantage of $25
    that you give me, and an advantage of $25 that occurs by chance during the game?
    In either case, the $25 advantage is likely to be diluted as we
    play the game longer and longer, so that as a percentage of the total,
    the $25 becomes tiny, and the relative frequency with which each of us
    wins approaches 50%.
    However, the difference between, say, 50.5% of $1,000,000 and 49.5% of $1,000,000
    is $10,000, which is still a lot of money, even if it is only a small
    fraction of the total we have wagered.
</p>

<p>
    The Law of Large Numbers implies that in repeated
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#simple_random_sample">random sampling with replacement</a>
    from a box of tickets, as the number of samples increases, the fraction of
    times each ticket is drawn is increasingly likely to be <span class="math">1/(#tickets in the box)</span>.
    If the tickets are labeled with numbers, the fraction of times each label
    appears is increasingly likely to be close to the probability of drawing
    a ticket with that label (the fraction of tickets in the box that have
    that label).

<p>
    The fraction of children born who are girls is a very stable demographic variable
    across societies and geography: about 49% of children born are girls and about
    51% are boys.
    (Because their mortality rate is lower, women outnumber men later in life.)
    Suppose that the gender of children is determined at random at the
    time of conception, with probability 49% of being female and probability 51%
    of being male.
    Suppose the genders of different children are independent.
    Consider a city in which about 10,000 children are born each year,
    and a town in which about 100 children are born each year.
    In a given year, is it more likely that of the children born in the city,
    the percentage of who are female will exceed 55%, or that of the children
    born in the town, the percentage who are female will exceed 55%?
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Solution</strong>.
    The fraction of girl children born in the city is like the fraction of
    successes in about 10,000 independent trials with the same
    49% chance of success in each trial.
    The fraction of girl children born in the town is like the fraction of successes
    in about 100 independent trials with the same 49% chance of success in each trial.
    The larger the number of trials, the less likely it is that the fraction of
    successes differs from the chance of success by any given amount
    (such as 55%&minus;49%=6%).
    It is more likely that the fraction of girl children born in the town will exceed 55%.

<h2><a id="expectation"></a>
   The Expected Value
</h2>

<p>
    The Law of Large Numbers says that in repeated independent trials,
    the relative frequency with which an event occurs tends to approach the
    probability that the event occurs (the precise statement is slightly
    different: The chance that the two differ finitely goes to zero as
    the number of trials increases).
    For example, in repeated draws with replacement from a box of tickets,
    the fraction of times each ticket is drawn will tend to approach
    1/(#tickets in the box).
    If the tickets are labeled with numbers, the average number on the
    tickets drawn will tend to approach the average of list of the
    labels on all the tickets, including repeated labels as many times as
    they occur.
</p>

<p>
    Suppose a box contains one ticket labeled &quot;0,&quot; two tickets
    labeled &quot;1,&quot; and one ticket labeled &quot;4:&quot;
</p>

<div class="boxModel">
   <p class="boxLabel">
      Box to illustrate expected value
   </p>
   <div class="boxContents">
      <p class="boxTickets">0</p>
      <p class="boxTickets">1</p>
      <p class="boxTickets">1</p>
      <p class="boxTickets">4</p>
   </div>
</div><p>
    Repeated random draws with replacement from the box will yield the ticket
    labeled &quot;0&quot; about one fourth of the time, a ticket labeled &quot;1&quot; about half
    the time, and the ticket labeled &quot;4&quot; about one fourth of the time.
    In the long run, the average of the draws will tend to approach
    <span class="math">(0+1+1+4)/4&nbsp;=&nbsp;6/4&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.5</span>,
    the average of the numbers on the tickets.
    This long-run average outcome of a draw from a box is called the
    <em>expected value</em> of the draw.
    The expected value of a random variable <span class="math">X</span> is the long-run limiting average of the
    values <span class="math">X</span> takes in repeated trials.
</p>

<p>
    The expected value of a random variable is analogous to the <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#mean">mean</a>
    of a list: It is the balance point of the
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#probability_histogram">probability histogram</a>,
    just as the mean is the balance point of the histogram of the list.

    Draw a ticket a few times by clicking the Take Sample button in
<script language="JavaScript1.4" type="text/javascript"><!--

    Sometimes the ticket drawn will be labeled &quot;0,&quot; sometimes it will be
    labeled &quot;1,&quot; and sometimes it will be labeled &quot;4.&quot;
    You will see a histogram of the labels on the tickets drawn evolve
    as you take more samples.
    In repeated draws, about one-fourth of the draws will give the ticket
    labeled &quot;0,&quot; about half of the draws will give a ticket labeled &quot;1,&quot;
    and about one-fourth of the draws will give a the ticket labeled &quot;4.&quot;
    Change the Take ________ samples to 1000, and click the Take Sample
    button a few times.
</p>

<p>
    The empirical distribution of the draws will tend to stabilize with
    about 1/4 of the draws giving the ticket labeled &quot;0,&quot; about 1/2 of
    the draws giving the ticket labeled &quot;1,&quot; and about 1/4 of the
    draws giving the ticket labeled &quot;4.&quot;
    That the empirical fraction of the draws that give &quot;0&quot; tends towards
    the probability of drawing the ticket labeled &quot;0,&quot; and the
    empirical fraction of the draws that give &quot;1&quot; tends towards
    the probability of drawing a ticket labeled &quot;1,&quot; etc. is a consequence
    of the <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#law_of_large_numbers">Law of Large Numbers</a>.
    Because the tickets in the box tend to be represented in equal proportion
    in the samples, the average of the draws will tend to be close to the
    average of the list of labels on the tickets in the box:
</p>

<p class="math">
    0&times;(1/4) + 1&times;(1/2) + 4&times;(1/4) = 1.5.
</p>

<p>
    This is the <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#expectation">expected value</a> of the number on a ticket
    drawn at random from the box.
</p>

<p>
    The quantity &quot;Mean(values),&quot; shown on the left, is the

    of the observed values of the <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#sample_sum">sample sum</a>,
    and &quot;SD(values)&quot; is the <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#sd">SD</a> of

    Once you have drawn a few thousand samples, Mean(values) should be very close to 1.5.

    of size 2 with replacement from the box.
    The possible values of the sample sum of two draws with replacement from the box
    are 0, 1, 4, 5, and 8.
    The sample sum is zero if both tickets drawn are labeled &quot;0.&quot;
    That happens with probability 1/4&times;1/4=1/16.
    The sample sum is one 1 if one of the tickets drawn is labeled &quot;0&quot;
    and one is labeled &quot;1.&quot;
    That can happen by drawing a ticket labeled &quot;0&quot; on the first draw and a
    ticket labeled &quot;1&quot; on the second draw, which occurs with probability
    1/4&times;1/2=1/8.
    It also can happen by drawing a ticket labeled &quot;1&quot; on the first draw and
    a ticket labeled &quot;0&quot; on the second draw, which occurs with probability
    1/2&times;1/4=1/8, so the total chance that the sample sum of two draws

<p>
    In general, the expected value of a discrete random variable <span class="math">X</span>
    can be calculated
    from the <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#probability_distribution">probability distribution</a>
    of <span class="math">X</span>:
    The expected value of <span class="math">X</span> is a weighted average of the values
    <span class="math">X</span> can take.
    The weight of each possible value of <span class="math">X</span> is the probability that
    <span class="math">X</span> equals that value.
    This is exactly how we would calculate the mean of a list that has repeated entries:
    We would sum the distinct numbers in the list, each times its relative frequency
    in the list.
    If there were no repeated numbers, the relative frequencies would all
    be 1/(#items in the list), which gives the ordinary arithmetic mean, the sum of the
    values divided by the number of values.

    In symbols, one writes <span class="math">E(X)</span> for the expected value of the
    random variable <span class="math">X</span>.
    The expected value of <span class="math">X</span> depends only on the probability
    distribution of <span class="math">X</span>:
    If two random variables have the same probability distribution,
    they have the same expected value.
    For example, the expected number of times a fair coin lands heads in five tosses is
    the same as the expected number of times a fair die lands showing an even
    number of spots in five rolls, because both have a
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#binomial">binomial distribution</a>
    with parameters <em>n</em>=5 and <em>p</em>=50%.
    Because the expected value of a random variable depends only on its probability
    distribution, we can speak of the expected value of a random variable or the
    expected value of a probability distribution interchangeably.

<p>
   <span class="termOfArt">Expected value</span> is a technical term.
   It has little to do with the ordinary English usage of the word &quot;expect.&quot;
   The expected value of a random variable does not have to be a possible value of the random
   variable.
   In particular, a random variable that only takes integer values can have an expected value that
   has a fractional part.
   For instance, suppose you invite 3 friends over for dinner.
   They each toss a fair coin, independently, to decide whether to come: Heads they come, tails they don't.
   (Your friends are <em>such</em> geeks.  Time to make friends with some humanities majors &hellip;)
</p>

<p>
   You invite them all many many many many times.
   Sometimes, all three friends' coins land heads; then you have 3 guests.
   That happens about 1/8 of the time, in the long run.
   Sometimes all three coins land tails; then nobody shows up.
   That also happens about 1/8 of the time, in the long run.
   Sometimes one or two friends come; that happens about 3/8 of the time each.
</p>

<p>
   On average, in the long run, the number of friends who come over is
</p>

<p class="math">
       0&times;1/8 + 1&times;3/8 + 2&times;3/8 + 3&times;1/8 = 12/8 = 1.5.
</p>

<p>
    That's the expected number of friends who come over.
    It is impossible for a fraction of a dinner guest show up, but the expected value has
    a fractional part.
</p>

<p>
    The following exercise asks you to calculate the expected value of a
    random variable from its probability distribution.

    What is the expected value of the sample sum of two draws with replacement from the
    box that contains one ticket labeled &quot;0,&quot; two labeled &quot;1,&quot;
    and one labeled &quot;4&quot;?
</p>

<p>
    By the <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#law_of_large_numbers">Law of Large Numbers</a>, in
    repeated draws, the fraction of times a particular
    ticket (say the <em>j</em>th ticket) appears is increasingly likely to be close to
    1/(#tickets in the box).
    Drawing a pair of tickets with replacement <em>M</em> times gives 2<em>M</em> tickets in all.
    As <em>M</em> grows, the fraction of times the <em>j</em>th ticket appears is
    increasingly likely to be close to 2/(#tickets in the box),
    so the <em>j</em>th ticket is increasingly likely to contribute about

    The total of the contributions from all the tickets to

<p>
    The average of the sum of two draws is thus
    increasingly likely to be close to 2&times;(average of the numbers on all the tickets).
    Indeed, this is the expected value of the sample sum of two random draws from the
    box.
    Similar reasoning shows that in general the expected value of the sample sum of
    <em>n</em> draws with replacement from a box of numbered tickets is
</p>

<p class="math">
    <em>n</em>&times;(average of the numbers on all the tickets).

<div class="indent">
<p class="inline">
    Perhaps surprisingly, that is also the expected value
    of the sample sum of <em>n</em> draws without replacement (of course, then the number of
    draws, <em>n</em>, can not be larger than the number of tickets in the box, <em>N</em>).

    shows the sampling tool again, but now with a check box that lets you
    control whether the sampling is with or without replacement.
    If the box is checked, the sample is drawn with replacement.
    In sampling without replacement, the size of each sample cannot exceed
    the number of tickets in the box.
    Experiment by looking at the average of the values of the sample sum
    for a large number of samples, with and without replacement.
    Try putting different lists of numbers in the box.
    Whether the sampling is with or without replacement, the average of the
    sample sums (Mean(values)) will be close to (sample size)&times;(average of box)
    after a few thousand draws.
    If the sample size is greater than one, the SD of the values of the sample sum
    will tend to be smaller for sampling without replacement than for sampling
    with replacement.

<p>
    When the tickets in the box are labeled only &quot;0&quot; or &quot;1,&quot; the
    the sum of <em>n</em> random draws with replacement has a
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#binomial">binomial</a> distribution,
    and the sum of <em>n</em> random draws without replacement has an
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#hypergeometric">hypergeometric</a> distribution.
    These special cases of the expected value of the sum of random draws from a box
    are particularly simple.

        <p>
            If a box has a fraction <em>p</em> of tickets labeled &quot;1&quot;
            and a fraction (1-<em>p</em>) of tickets labeled &quot;0,&quot; the
            average of the labels on the

        </p>
        <p class="math">
            0&times;(1-<em>p</em>) + 1&times;<em>p</em> = <em>p</em>.

        <p>
            If a box has a fraction <em>p</em> of tickets labeled &quot;1&quot;
            and a fraction (1-<em>p</em>) of tickets labeled &quot;0,&quot; the

        </p>
</div>

<p>
    Because the sum of <em>n</em> random draws with
    replacement from a box that contains a fraction <em>p</em> of tickets
    labeled &quot;1&quot;
    and a fraction (1-<em>p</em>) of tickets labeled &quot;0&quot; has a
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#binomial">binomial distribution</a> with parameters
    <em>n</em> and <em>p</em>,
    this means that the <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#expectation">expected value</a>
    of (a random
    variable with) a binomial distribution with parameters <em>n</em> and
    <em>p</em> is <em>n</em>&times;<em>p</em>.
    You can also confirm this from the formula for binomial probabilities
    (but the algebra is complicated):
</p>

<p class="math">
    0&times;<em><sub>n</sub></em>C<sub>0</sub>
    <em>p</em><sup>0</sup>(1-<em>p</em>)<sup><em>n</em>-0</sup>
      + 1&times;<em><sub>n</sub></em>C<sub>1</sub>
    <em>p</em><sup>1</sup>(1-<em>p</em>)<sup><em>n</em>-1</sup>

    <em>n</em>&times;<em><sub>n</sub></em>C<em><sub>n</sub></em>
    <em>p<sup>n</sup></em>(1-<em>p</em>)<sup>0</sup>
      = <em>n</em>&times;<em>p</em>.
</p>

<p>
    On average, each draw results in <em>p</em> tickets
    labeled &quot;1.&quot;
</p>

<p>
    Similarly, because the sum of <em>n</em> random draws without replacement from a box of
    <em>N</em> tickets of which <em>G</em> are labeled &quot;1&quot; and
    (<em>N</em>-<em>G</em>) are labeled &quot;0&quot; has an

    <em>N</em>, <em>G</em>, and <em>n</em>, the expected value of (a random variable with)

<p>
    The expected value satisfies several quite useful
    rules that make it easy to find the expected value of sums of random variables and
    constants times random variables. These properties follow from the facts that
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
    The average of a list of numbers that are all equal is just
    their common value.
    </li>
    <li>
    If you add two lists together, the average of the sum is
    the sum of the averages of the separate lists.
    </li>
    <li>
    If you multiply every element of a list by some constant,
    the average of the new list is the average of the old list, multiplied by the same constant.
    </li>
</ol>


<div class="callout">
        <p>
            <span class="calloutCaption">Properties of the Expected Value</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            The <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#expectation">expected value</a>
           of a constant (a constant random variable) is that
            constant: for any number <em>a</em>,
        </p>
        <p class="math">
            E(<em>a</em>) = <em>a</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The expected value of the sum of two or more random variables is the sum
            of their expected values: If <span class="math">X, Y, Z, &hellip;</span> are
            random variables, then
        </p>
        <p class="math">
            E(X+Y+Z+ &hellip;) = E(X) + E(Y) + E(Z) + &hellip; .
        </p>
        <p>
            The expected value of a constant times a random variable is that
            constant times the <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#expectation">expected value</a> of the random
            variable: for any constant <span class="math">a</span> and any random variable

        </p>
        <p class="math">
            E(a &times; X) = a &times; E(X).
        </p>
</div>

<p>
    These rules can be summarized as follows: if <span class="math">a</span>
    and <span class="math">b</span> are any two numbers, and <span class="math">X</span> and
    <span class="math">Y</span> are any two random variables, then
</p>

<p class="math">
    E(<em>a</em> &times; X + <em>b</em> &times; Y) = <em>a</em> &times; E(X) +
    <em>b</em> &times; E(Y).
</p>

<p>
    In general, <span class="math">E(X &times; Y)</span> is <em>not</em> equal to
    <span class="math">E(X) &times; E(Y)</span> (but see

    Recall that a transformation of <em>x</em> of the form <em>y</em> = <em>a&times;x</em>+<em>b</em>,
    where <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> are fixed numbers, is called an
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#affine">affine transformation</a>.
    A graph of an affine transformation is a straight line.

<p>
    The <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#sample_mean">sample mean</a> is the
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#sample_sum">sample sum</a> divided by the sample size, <em>n</em>.
    Dividing by the sample size is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, 1/<em>n</em>,
    so we can use the properties of expectation to find the expected value of the sample
    mean from the expected value of the sample sum:
    The expected value of
    the sample mean is the expected value of the sample sum, times 1/<em>n</em>.
    Because the expected value of the sample sum is
</p>

<p class="math">
    <em>n</em>&times;(average of the numbers on all the tickets in box),
</p>

<p>
    whether the sampling is with or without replacement, the expected value of the
    sample mean is the average of the numbers on all the tickets in the box,
    for random sampling with or without replacement.
</p>

<p>
    Consider a 0-1 box of tickets.
    The <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#population_percentage">population percentage</a> is the fraction
    of tickets labeled &quot;1.&quot;
    Equivalently, it is the mean of the list of the numbers on all the tickets.
    The <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#sample_percentage">sample percentage</a> <em>&phi;</em>
    is the fraction of
    tickets labeled &quot;1&quot; in a random sample of size <em>n</em> from such a box;
    equivalently, it is the sample mean of a random sample of size <em>n</em> from such
    a box:
</p>

<p class="math">
    <em>&phi;</em> = (#tickets in the sample labeled &quot;1&quot;)/<em>n</em>.
</p>

<p>
    It follows that the expected value of the sample percentage <em>&phi;</em>

<p>
    In games of chance, the expected value of the payoff (taking into
    account the cost of the bet) determines whether a bet is favorable.
    If the expected value of the payoff is negative, in the long run,
    you will tend to lose money.
    If the expected payoff is positive, you will tend to win money
    in the long run.
    If the expected payoff is zero, you tend to break even in the long run.
    In casino games, the expected payoff is always negative.
    The expected amount you lose to the house (the casino) for each $1 bet is called the
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#house_edge">house edge</a>.

    In roulette, a bet of $1 on red pays $2 if you win.
    There are 18 red positions on the wheel, out of a total of 38 positions.
    By assumption, the ball is equally likely to land in any of the 38 positions;
    you win the bet on red if the ball lands in a red position.
    The expected payoff for a $1 bet is thus $2&times;(18/38) - $1 = -$.0526, so the

    Consider playing the following dice game: we roll a pair of dice five times.
    We lose $100 each time the pair of
    dice does not land showing double ones, and win $1000 each time the pair lands showing
    double ones.
    What is the <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#expectation">expected</a> net profit or loss?
    Is this a fair bet?
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Solution</strong>.
    Let <span class="math">X</span> be the number of double ones in five rolls of a pair of fair dice.
    Then <span class="math">X</span> has a <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#binomial">binomial distribution</a>
    with parameters <span class="math">n = 5</span> and <span class="math">p = 100%/36</span>, so
</p>

<p class="math">
    E(X) = 5/36 = 0.138 pairs of ones.
</p>

<p>
    Your winnings are
</p>

<p class="math">
    W = X &times; $1000 - (5 - X) &times; $100.
</p>

<p>
    <span class="math">W</span> is a constant times <span class="math">X</span>,
    plus another constant; that is, <span class="math">W</span> is an
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#affine">affine transformation</a> of <span class="math">X</span>:
</p>

<p class="math">
    W = $1100 &times; X - $500.
</p>

<p>
    Thus the <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#expectation">expected value</a> of W is
</p>

<p class="math">
    E(W) = $1100 &times; E(X) - $500 = -$347.22.
</p>

<p>
    This is not a fair bet&mdash;you should expect to lose money in the long run in repeated play.
</p>

<p>
    Here is another way to calculate your expected net winnings.
    The net winnings in this game
    is the sum of the winnings in five shorter games, each of which consists of rolling the
    pair of dice once.
    Your expected winnings in each of the smaller games is
</p>

<p class="math">
    $1000 &times; 1/36 - $100 &times; 35/36 = -$69.44.
</p>
<p>
    Your expected total winnings from the 5 games is the sum
    of my expected winnings from each game:
</p>

<p class="math">
    -$69.44 - $69.44 - &hellip; - $69.44 = 5 &times; -$69.44
     = -$347.22.

    The following exercises check your ability to determine the distribution of a random
    variable from a verbal description, to find the expected value
    of the random variable, and to determine whether a bet is fair.

    Summary
</h2>

<p>
    In repeated <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#independent">independent</a>
    trials with the same probability of success,
    as the number of trials increases, the fraction of successes is
    increasingly likely to be close to the probability of success in each trial.
    This is the <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#law_of_large_numbers">Law of Large Numbers</a>.
    As a consequence of the Law of Large Numbers, if a <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#discrete">discrete</a>
    random variable is observed repeatedly in independent experiments,
    the fraction of experiments in which the random variable equals any
    of its possible values is increasingly likely to be close to the
    probability that the random variable equals that value.
    The mean of the observed values of the random variable in repeated
    independent experiments is thus increasingly likely to be close to a
    weighted average of the possible values, where the weights are the
    probabilities of the values.
    That weighted average is called the
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#expectation">expected value</a>
    of the random variable.
    The expected value of a random variable depends only on the probability
    distribution of the random variable, so we can speak interchangeably of the
    expected value of a random variable or of its probability distribution.
</p>

<p>
    The expected value of the sample sum of <em>n</em> random draws with or without
    replacement from a box of numbered tickets is <em>n</em> times the mean of the
    numbers on all the tickets in the box, including duplicates as often as they occur.
    For the special case of a 0-1 box, this implies that the expected value of the
    binomial distribution with parameters <em>n</em> and <em>p</em> is <em>n</em>&times;<em>p</em>,
    and that the expected value of the hypergeometric distribution with parameters
    N, G, and <em>n</em> is <em>n</em>&times;G/N.
    The expected value of a constant times a random variable is that constant times
    the expected value of the random variable.
    The expected value of the sum of two or more random variables is the sum of their
    expected values.
    It follows that the expected value of the sample mean of <em>n</em>
    draws with or without replacement from a box of numbered tickets is the mean of the
    numbers on all the tickets in the box; as a special case, the expected value of the
    sample percentage of <em>n</em> random draws with or without replacement from a
    0-1 box is the population percentage of tickets in the box labeled &quot;1.&quot;
    The expected value of the geometric distribution with parameter <em>p</em> is 1/<em>p</em>.
    The expected value of the negative binomial distribution with parameters <em>r</em> and <em>p</em>
    is <em>r</em>/<em>p</em>.
    The house edge in a bet is the expected value of the net loss to the bettor per
    $1 bet.
    A bet is fair if the expected net payoff (accounting for the ante) is zero.
