   Why Statistics?

</h2>



<hr size="4" width="60%">



<p>

Most mathematics courses teach students how to solve very

specific problems. Two examples are solving quadratic equations

and finding unknown measures of angles in a geometric diagram.

Few, however, teach students how to reason mathematically,

perhaps combining different techniques to solve one problem.

Statistics is often taught as a mathematics subject with

seemingly independent parts (chapters). This chapter introduces

basic ideas and concepts of statistical thinking and reasoning

which are necessary to an understanding of the mathematical side

of subject. A major theme of the chapter is on the consequences

of being completely ignorant of chance and statistical ideas. <br>

<h3 align="center"><b>Quantitative Literacy</b></h3>



<p>For many years now our schools and local, state, and federal

governments have been concerned with illiteracy among students

and adults. As a result many reading programs have been

established to make sure that the citizens of the United States

have basic skills in reading. Clearly, the consequences of an

illiterate population would be detrimental. What has not been so

well accepted is that having a citizenship ill-prepared&nbsp; in

quantitative reasoning and skills can be just as detrimental, not

only to their personal well-being, but also to society. </p>



<p>Over the past 15 years or so there has been a lot of

discussion on the importance of &quot;quantitative

literacy,&quot;&nbsp; partly because changes in our society

increasingly require quantitative skills. More than ever, our

society depends on computers, using them to store, retrieve, and

analyze vast amounts of data. In a recent collection of articles

on quantitative literacy (Steen, 1997) all the authors argue -

from various perspectives - that individuals lacking quantitative

skills will be at a significant disadvantage. Lynn Arthur Steen,

the editor of the articles, says: </p>



<blockquote>

    <p><font size="2" face="Courier New,Courier">Ever since

    computers opened the floodgates of the information age, we

    have been caught in a rising tide of numbers. The ascendency

    of quantitative information has changed profoundly not only

    the environment in which we live and work, but also the

    entire framework of civic life...[The] constructs of modern

    civilation depend at their deepest level on quantitative

    information. Does the Dow average really measure the state of

    the economy? How can we best evaluate the quality of health

    care? Do polls influence or just predict how people will

    vote? How strong is the evidence linking estrogen supplemenst

    to increased rates of breast cancer in older women? Do the

    new bar code readers make more or fewer mistakes than trained

    checkout clerks? How secure are bank accounts from ATM fraud?</font>

    </p>

    <p><font size="2" face="Courier New,Courier">Numeracy is the

    new literacy of our age. As the printing press gave the power

    of letters to the masses, so the computer gives the power of

    numbers to ordinary citizens...But just as literacy was

    relatively rare five centuries ago, so is numeracy today.

    Only one in ten U.S. adults can reliably solve problems that

    require two or more steps. Even fewer can comprehend the

    complexity of issues that underlie clinical trials of new

    treatments for AIDS or think through the implications of a

    flat-tax system...The majority of today's high school

    graduates - not to mention dropouts - still lack fundamental

    &quot;walking around&quot; skills in quantitative literacy.</font></p>

</blockquote>



<p>In the same book, Iddo Gal,&nbsp; former director of the Adult

Numeracy Project at the National Center on Adult Literacy, notes

that today &quot;adults face quantitative tasks in multiple

situations whose contexts require seemless integration of

numeracy and literacy skills.&quot; Some of these situations

include home (e.g., coordinating schedules); personal finance

(e.g., monitoring expenses and filling out tax forms); social

action (e.g., design a survey for a local action group); work

place (e.g., statistical process control and optimizing

resources); active parenting (e.g., understanding standardized

tests and statistics about schools). Some of these situations may

only require interpretation: <br>

&nbsp; </p>



<blockquote>

    <p><font size="2" face="Courier New,Courier">These demand

    that people make sense of, and grasp the implications of,

    verbal or text-based messages that may rest on quntitaive

    issues but that do not involve direct manipulation of

    numbers; for example, when reading a newspaper or watching

    news on TV, being faced with results of a recent poll or

    medical experiment, possibly involving percentages, averages,

    rates of change, etc. Such situations may sometimes involve

    no numbers at all but still refer to important ideas that are

    part of mathematics or statistics, as when samples, bias,

    correlation, or causality are implied.</font> <br>

    &nbsp;</p>

</blockquote>



<p>The main message of these and other authors is that today more

and more situations require quantitative skills for proper

solution or management. Since most of these situations involve

data that are used to draw conclusions, individuals need to

understand: <br>

&nbsp; </p>



<ul>

    <li><ul>

            <li>how their particular data arise or are collected</li>

            <li>how to summarize the data</li>

            <li>how to interpret results based on their analyses

                of the data</li>

        </ul>

    </li>

</ul>



<p align="left">Although mathematics is important to these

skills, it is perhaps more important to learn the underlying

statistical ideas and methods. Some examples of the consequences

of a lack of quantitative literacy (&quot;innumeracy&quot;) are

given below. The main goal of this book is teach you a part of

statistics you need in everyday life.<br>

&nbsp; </p>



<h3 align="center">Useful Stuff for the Real World</h3>



<p>As we went through our usual mathematics courses in primary

school, many of us wondered whether any of the mathematics we

were learning would ever be useful. It is very easy to point to a

lot of mathematics that is not directly related to everyday life,

but it is also easy to point to mathematical tools that are

extremely useful. Some of the most useful are statistical.<br>

&nbsp; </p>



<h4>Strength in Numbers</h4>



<p>St. John's Wort (<i>Hypericum perforatum</i>) is an herbal

extract that is receiving a lot of attention as a mood enhancer,

especially in improving depression, anxiety, and insomia. The

following excerpt from a <i>Newsweek </i>article (5 May 1997) is

typical of the many success stories of St. John's Wort. <br>

&nbsp; </p>



<blockquote>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    Karin Taylor's black moods were often accompanied by

    inexplicable bouts of <br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    insomnia, crying and lethargy. By last summer she had sunk so

    low she didn't care <br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    if she lived or died. But Taylor balked when her physician

    suggested a common <br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    antidepressant: she didn't feel comfortable taking drugs.

    Fortunately, she says, a <br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    friend visiting from California suggested a natural herb

    called Saint John's Wort. <br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    Within three weeks, Taylor's depression had lifted. &quot;I

    feel restored,&quot; says the <br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    58-year-old Toronto accountant, who continues to take two

    herb capsules daily. <br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    &quot;I'm my normal self again&quot;. <br>

    &nbsp;</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Like Karin Taylor, thousands of people report that St. John's

Wort (SJW) has significantly improved their depression and are

recommending the herbal extract to their relatives and friends.

SJW is not an herb that has recently been discovered. It has been

used for about 2,000 years by different cultures to ward off

'evil spirits.' Its use in the United States is relatively new.

Because SJW has been used for a few thousand years to ward off

evil spirits and now thousands of people swear by its positive

effects on depression, it would seem that SJW is indeed a useful

remedy for various psychological symptoms. The strength of the

evidence here is that so many people are convinced of its

efficacy. </p>



<p>Another example where the main argument depended on citing a

large number of positive experiences is taken from an article

(Steen, 1997) written by Gina Kolata, a science writer for the <i>New

York Times. </i>She reports on the opposition by many parents in

Princeton, New Jersey to classes that combine students from two

grades. In support of the nongraded program, someone informed the

school board that: &quot;In a review of 64 studies, cited in

ASCD's Educational Leadership issue of October 1992, research

clearly supports the use of nongraded programs.&quot; </p>



<p>The strength of the argument in both of the above examples is

on the number of positive reports. What was not explicitly

addressed was the quality and reliability of the data. By this we

mean specifying: </p>



<ol>

    <li>where the data came from (e.g., a study;&nbsp; informal

        survey; hearsay) </li>

    <li>who collected the data (e.g., radio station; research

        scientists in academia; private corporation) </li>

    <li>the subjects (e.g., a random sample of people; friends;

        white females age 18-30) <br>

        &nbsp;</li>

</ol>



<p>This list does not completely define quality and reliability

of data. It does, however, provide some guidelines for assessing

validity of evidence. For example, in the St. John's Wort case

nothing was said about &quot;clinical studies&quot; comparing SJW

to established antidepressants or whether the Food and Drug

Administration (FDA) recognizes SJW as a treatment for

depression. These are two important questions that we should ask

of all &quot;remedies&quot; that are reported to be effective

against some illness. All the evidence given in this example is

anecdotal. One of the main reasons that andecdotal evidence is

not reliable in this case is because people are more apt to

report positive experiences. No doubt there are many people who

have tried SJW without any mood enhancement. More than likely we

don't hear about it because they have forgotten about trying SJW

since it had no effect. In general, no matter how many people

report positive results, anecdotal evidence is not on equal par

with a well-designed clinical trial (chapter x). </p>



<p align="left">The example on nongraded programs did not say

anything about the studies other than that they favored combined

classes. Without knowing more about the studies we should not

conclude that combined grade levels are better than separate

grade levels. <br>

<h4>The Life of a Statistic</h4>



<p>There are many statistics on <a href="http://trfn.clpgh.org/bcis/GeneralInfo/what.html">cancer</a>.

One type of cancer that is receiving a lot of attention these

days is <a href="http://trfn.clpgh.org/bcis/GeneralInfo/GenType.html">breast

cancer</a>, which is reported to be the second leading cause of

death in women. For example, it is often reported that: </p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One in eight women will get breast cancer in

their lifetimes. </p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every 11 minutes another woman dies of breast

cancer. </p>



<p>These statistics say or mean different things to different

people. If they are misinterpreted or taken as gospel they could

cause a lot of unnecessary anxiety. In a collection of articles

on judgement under uncertainty (Kahneman, Slovic, and Tversky,

1982), Max Singer writes about the &quot;vitality of mythical

numbers.&quot; He reminds us that many numbers or statistics have

no basis in fact and that &quot;because an estimate has been used

widely by a variaety of people who should know what they're

talking about , one cannot assume that the estimate is even

approximately correct.&quot; Does this mean that we should not

trust any numbers reported by such people as scientists,

journalists, and politicians? No. What it does mean, however, is

that to take a statistic seriously we need to be willing to

investigate the life of the statistic: who's responsible for it?

how did it come about? does it make sense relative to general

knowledge? what does it imply? </p>



<p>What then are we to make of&nbsp; the breast cancer

statistics? Let's first consider the second statistic: every 11

minutes another woman dies of breast cancer. Should we take this

statistic literally? To answer this question we have to know how

the number was determined. Link to the the <a href="http://www.feminist.org/other/bc/bcfact.html">Breast Cancer

Fact Sheet</a> sponsored by the Breast Cancer Information

Service,&nbsp; find the 11 minute statistic, and then return to

this page. We are not told how the statistic was determined, but

we are given its source, the National Breast Cancer Coalition.

With the internet it would be very easy to find the web site for

this organization and then try to track down the basis for the

statistic. This exercise will be pursued below. For the moment

let's think about how we might arrive at the statistic; there is

a hint in the fact sheet. We are told that in 1991, 43,582 women

died of breast cancer. Dividing 43,582 by the total number of

minutes in a year (525,600) we find: 43,582 deaths per year /

525,600 minutes per year = 1 death per 12.06 minutes </p>



<p align="left">We don't get 11, but our reasoning gets us close

to what has been reported. The statistic, therefore, would appear

to have some basis. An interpretation of the above result is that

every 12 minutes a woman dies of breast cancer. However, as the

calculation shows, the number of deaths have been evenly

distributed throughout the year without knowledge of when the

deaths actually occurred. Therefore, the statement that

&quot;every 12 minutes a woman dies of breast cancer&quot; is an

approximation to what actually happened. For example, it might

have happened that no such deaths occurred in the second week of

October.<br>

&nbsp; </p>



<h3 align="center"><font color="#006600">Exercises</font></h3>



<p><font color="#000000">3. Why do you think the above result

does not agree with what is reported by the National Breast

Cancer Coalition?</font> <a href="#sol_3">Solution</a> </p>



<p><font color="#000000">4. How many deaths would need to occur

in a year for there to be &quot;a woman dying from breast cancer

every 6 minutes&quot;?</font> <a href="#sol_4">Solution</a> <br>

&nbsp; </p>



<p align="left">Let us now consider the 1 in 8 statistic. Again,

the fact sheet gives the <font color="#000000">National Breast

Cancer Coalition as the source of the number. What does the

number mean? It does not mean that at this moment, any given

woman has a 1 in 8 chance of developing or &quot;getting&quot;

breast cancer. The fact is that the incidence ( number of new

cases in a population within a given time period) of breast

cancer rises with age. The National Cancer Institute gives the

following incidence rates:</font> <br>

&nbsp; <br>

&nbsp; <br>

&nbsp; </p>

<div align="center"><center>

        <td align="center">128.3</td>

    </tr>

</table>

</center></div>



<p align="left">&nbsp; <br>

&nbsp;The 1 in 8 statistic is a <i>lifetime</i> incidence rate:

among women who live to be 95 years old, 1 in 8 of them will get

breast cancer sometime in their lifetime. This information puts

the 1 in 8 statistic in a different perspective. And the same

will be true for other statistics that are frequently reported

and cited if they are properly investigated. It may sound like a

lot of work just to understand a number, but we hope that we have

convinced you of the importance of taking numbers seriously. When

gone unchecked, statistics can take on a life of their own. Did

you hear the one about 1 in 4 college women experiencing date

rape? <br>

<h4>Numbers Set in Stone</h4>



<p>Stephen Jay Gould is a well known scientist who teaches

biology, geology, and the history of science at Harvard. He has

written several popular book on science. The following is an

excerpt from an article (<i>Discover</i>, June 1995) he wrote

that discusses a popular statistic that attempts to measure the

&quot;middle&quot; of a list of numbers or a data set. <br>

&nbsp; <br>

&nbsp; <br>

&nbsp; </p>



<blockquote>

    <p><font size="2" face="Courier New,Courier">In 1982, I

    learned I was suffering from a rare and serious cancer. After

    surgery, I asked my doctor what the best technical literature

    on the cancer was. She told me, with a touch of diplomacy,

    that there was nothing really worth reading. I soon realized

    why she had offered that humane advice: my cancer is

    incurable, with a median mortality of eight months after

    discovery.</font> <br>

    &nbsp; <br>

    &nbsp;</p>

</blockquote>



<p>The statistic of interest in this case is &quot;median

mortality of eight months.&quot; Again, we have a number -- 8

months -- that has been provided by a reputable person, namely,

the surgeon. Now, the surgeon probably knows what the statistic

means, but many of her patients will not know. Even if people do

not know what median mortality means they may have some

preconceived notion of &quot;similar&quot; statistics or they may

form a &quot;definition&quot; on the spot. There is also the

business of median mortality <i>after discovery</i>. What does

this mean? Does &quot;after discovery&quot; matter? As before, we

begin by stating what is not meant by &quot;median mortality of

eight months after discovery.&quot;&nbsp; The eight month figure

is not a limit: the statistic does not mean that at the eighth

month after being diagnosed with the cancer you <i>will </i>die.

Clearly, Professor Gould is a counterexample to this nonsense.

(Why?) To find out what it actually means <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~chance/teaching_aids/median.html">read

the article by Gould</a>. </p>



<p align="left">The point of this example is that many numbers

(in &quot;real life&quot;) are reported or interpreted as if they

are followed by everyone. To wit, everyone who has the same

cancer afflicting Professor Gould will die after 8 months of

diagnosis. The fact of the matter is that some will survive much

longer than 8 months, while some will live only a few months

after diagnosis. In statistical jargon we say that people vary

according to their survival times after diagnosis. That's the way

it is with most statistics that are reported. More obvious

examples abound. The average salary of a new electrical enginner

may be $48,000 per year, but not all such engineers make this

salary. <br>

<h4>Gambler's Fallacy</h4>



<p>A gambler playing a game of dice in Las Vegas has lost seven

times in a row, losing $50 each time. Should she continue to

play? Some may argue that she's having bad luck and should stop.

Others may argue that she should continue to play, maybe

increasing her bet, because by the &quot;law of averages&quot;

she is bound to win after losing so many times. The latter is a

myth and is known as the gambler's fallacy: in playing the same

game over and over, the chance of winning is not more likely

after a string of losses than it was at the first game.

Similarly, the chance of losing is not more likely after a string

of wins than it was at the first game. This fallacy, or some

version of it, is invoked in many other situations; for example: </p>



<dl compact>

    <dt>a.</dt>

    <dd>A telemarketer tries you at home everyday for two weeks

        between 7 and 9pm, but does not get an answer (assume you

        do not have an answering machine). The supervisor asks

        how long it will be before the telemarketer thinks you

        will be reached during those times. The telemarketer

        invokes the gambler's fallacy and says that it shouldn't

        be long, now.</dd>

    <dt>b.</dt>

    <dd>A baseball announcer observes that a certain player has

        not hit in his last 22 at bats. &quot;By the law of

        avergaes,&quot; he says, &quot;he's due to hit soon, and

        will probably go into a hitting streak.&quot;</dd>

    <dt>c.</dt>

    <dd>Many state lottos are based on matching numbers. For

        example, to win in the Texas State Lotto you must match

        the six numbers drawn from among fifty (numbered 1,2, 3,

        ... , 50). If the number 30 comes up in eight consecutive

        games it is highly unlikely to show up in the next game.</dd>

    <dt>d.</dt>

    <dd>John has been turned down for a date by the last 6 women

        he has asked out. Not surprisingly he is depressed. His

        friends have encourgaed him to keep trying. Afterall,

        they say, the law of averages promises a date in the near

        future.</dd>

</dl>



<p>The law of averages applies only under certain sircumstances,

and should not be blindly invoked. If misapplied it can lead to

wrong conclusions. We will discuss the law of averages in more

detail in later chapters. For now the most important things to

remember are: </p>



<p>1. The law of averages does not work by compensation. In

example (c), the chance that the number 30 does not show up in

the ninth game is the same as it is in any other game, namely

88%. </p>



<p align="left">2. The law of averages only applies to events

that are repeated under identical conditions. The Texas State

Lotto in example c is played under identical conditions each

Wednesday and Saturday. In example d, the situations under which

John requests a date are not identical because each woman is

different. <br>

<p>For over 50 years psychologists have relied on the Minnesota

Multiphasic Psychological Inventory (MMPI) to help evaluate and

diagnose mental disorders. The first version of the MMPI was

developed in 19xx by investigators at the University of Minnesota

Hospital. The subjects used to develop the test were visitors and

patients of the hospital's psychiatric ward. In 1989 a second

version of the MMPI, the MMPI-2, was developed. The MMPI-2 used a

larger sample of people from across the country than that used to

develop the original MMPI. </p>



<p>How reliable a test was the original MMPI? If you were a 55

year old Mexican-American woman in 1975 and a psychologist used

the MMPI to help evaluate you for depression, how much faith

would you have in it? The patients used to develop the original

MMPI were a special group of people. They were from the Midwest

and associated with the university's psychiatric ward in the

19xx's. It is unlikely that Mexican-American women were

represented in the subject group. Is there reason to believe that

the items which detected depression in the Minnesota subjects

should also apply to the Mexican-American woman? Clearly, if

there is no basis for extrapolation to individuals like yourself,

there is no reason to believe that studies based on subjects

different from yourself should apply to you. </p>



<p>From a statistical perspective the original MMPI should not be

used on subjects which do not match pertinent characteristics of

the Minnesota subjects. The problem with the original MMPI is its

design. It is interesting to note that in a 1993 survey of

clinicians about <a href="http://www.umn.edu/mmpi/PASTISSUES%20/93.4.1items.html">25%

said that they would continue to use the original MMPI</a>.

Knowledge of some basic statistical ideas and principles are very

important to the design of &quot;instruments&quot; such as the

MMPI, surveys, polls, and experiments. <br>

<p>A more extreme case is provided by <a href="http://www.kidsource.com/kidsource/content/hg/pg11.html">growth

charts showing how a child's height and weight change with age</a>.

In the weight chart there is a white band showing where the

weights are of most boys of a given age. For example,

approximately 95% of the ten year old boys (represented in this

chart) weigh 100 pounds or less, 50% weigh 70 pounds or less, and

5% weigh 55 pounds or less. The weights 100, 70, and 55 are the

95th, 50th, and 5th percentiles of the weights of 10 year old

boys. These percentiles can be read off the chart for other ages

in a similar manner. The first growth charts were based on 100

white boys and 100 white girls from Wisconsin. (**check on the

state**) Therefore, if other races do not grow at the same rate

as whites, then the first growth charts were not appropriate for

evaluating the growth of non-whites. In the <a href="http://www.kidsource.com/kidsource/content/hg/pg11.html">above

growth charts</a> there is no mention of race or the number of

boys that are represented in the chart. It would be helpful to

know at least this much more to make the charts more trustworthy

and useful. </p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;8. There is now strong evidence that a

certain gene, BRCA1, is associated with breast cancer. The gene

was discovered by a group of scientists in the United States. The

basic story is that if a woman has a certain mutation in BRCA1,

then she is at &quot;high&quot; risk for breast cancer. This

story is heavily based on statistical analysis. Suppose you are a

Chinese woman who is doing graduate work in the United States.

You are considering being tested for the mutation because your

mother had breast cancer. What questions might you ask of the

genetic counselors who would discuss the procedure with

you?&nbsp; **find a link for this question** <a href="#sol_8">Solution</a>

<h3 align="center">Assessment of Quantitative Literacy</h3>



<p>As mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, quantitative

literacy has received a lot of attention relatively recently. In

particular, the U.S. government has and continues to sponsor

quantitative literacy programs,as well assess quantitative skills

of the U.S. population. A leader in the field of quantitative

skills assessment is the <a href="htpp/nces.ed.gov/">National

Center for Educational Statistics</a>. Their purpose is to

collect and report &quot;...statistics and information showing

the condition and progress of education in the United States and

other nations in order to promote and accelerate the improvement

of American education.&quot; One way that they accomplish their

mission is by <a href="http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/datasurv.html">conducting

surveys</a>. Two surveys that deal explicitly with educational

assessment are the <a href="http://nces.ed.gov/NAEP/">National

Assessment of Education Progress</a> (NAEP) and the&nbsp; <a href="http://nces.ed.gov/nadlits/index.html">National Adult

Literacy Survey</a> (NALS): </p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<a href="http://nces.ed.gov/NAEP/">National Assessment of

Education Progress</a>: This survey is designed to continuously

monitor the <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

knowledge, skills, and performance of the nation's children and

youth. NAEP provides objective data on <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

student performance at national and regional levels in reading,

mathematics, science, writing, citizenship, <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

U.S. history, geography, socials studies, art, music, literature,

computer competence, and career and occupational <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

development. </p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<a href="http://nces.ed.gov/nadlits/index.html">National Adult

Literacy Survey</a>: The 1992 National Adult Literacy Survey

assessed the literacy skills of <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

the U.S. adult population (ages 16 and over living in

households), using simulations of three kinds of <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

literacy tasks that adults would ordinarily encounter in daily

life (prose literacy, document literacy, and <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

quantitative literacy). Representative data are available for 12

states (CA, FL, IL, IN, IA, LA, NJ, NY, OH, PA, <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

TX, WA) and for adults in prison. Participants also answered

questions about their demographic characteristics, <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

educational backgrounds, reading practices, and labor market

experiences. <br>

&nbsp; </p>



<p>The data that are collected from these and other surveys and

other organizations must be analyzed, summarized, and reported in

a meaningful way. Consider these questions posed by the National

Center for Education Statistics (NCES): <br>

&nbsp; </p>



<blockquote>

    <p>Is student enrollment growing or shrinking? What is the

    trend in teachers' salaries? How do states <br>

    compare in teacher/student ratios and educational attainment?

    Is the cost of college continuing to <br>

    rise?</p>

</blockquote>



<p>&nbsp; <br>

To address these questions the NCES relies on statistical

methods: <br>

&nbsp; </p>



<blockquote>

    <p>Finding the answers to these and many other questions is

    more than just a trivial pursuit. Statistics <br>

    are the directional signs along the road to quality education

    for all Americans. We must know <br>

    where we have been, so that we can better understand where we

    are going. </p>

    <p>Most Americans have memories of their own formal education

    and have strong opinions based on <br>

    those experiences. Personal contact is a powerful learning

    tool, but no single experience, no <br>

    matter how powerful, can compare with facts gathered from a

    broader perspective. Such is the <br>

    wealth of statistical material...</p>

</blockquote>



<p>&nbsp; <br>

We will return to the NAEP and NALS surveys in later chapters to

answer some specific questions regarding the state of education

in the United States. For now it is enough for you to know that

without statistics it would not be possible to make sense out of

the enormous amount of data collected on education. Education is

a very important part of all our lives. It is not an abstarct

topic discussed in the classroom; it is as &quot;real&quot; as it

gets. This is another case where statistics proves useful in the

&quot;real&quot; world. </p>



<p>Hopefully by now you have been convinced that it is worthwhile

learning a little about statistics. If not, simply do some

research of your own by trying to find areas where statistics

does not apply. You would be hard-pressed to find more than a

handful! There are many definitions of quantitative literacy, but

most include some aspects of statistical reasoning and basic

technique. When you are done working through this book you will

have learned some basic ideas, principles, and techniques of

statistics. We're sure that you will find them surprisingly

useful in other courses and life beyond the classroom (real

life?) <br>

<p>1. Anecdotal evidence may be based on just a few

&quot;success&quot; stories. Consider the situation where a few

of your high school classmates report a 100 point increase in the

SAT after taking a prep course for the test. Would this

constitute successful preparation? </p>



<p><a name="sol_2"></a>2. Most of the studies could have been

based on experiments in private schools. Another possibility is

that the conclusions of the studies could have been based solely

on teacher opinion, excluding student and parent opinions. </p>



<p><a name="sol_3"></a>3. One reason is that the &quot;11

minutes&quot; statistic may be based on data from a year

different from 1991, which is the year that our calculation is

based. Another possibility is that the &quot;11 minutes&quot; and

&quot;12 minutes&quot; statistics are from different data

sources. The former is from the National Breast Cancer Coalition

and the latter is from the National Cancer Institute. </p>



<p><a name="sol_4"></a>4. About twice as many as required for 1

death every 12 minutes. So, about 87, 164. More generally, <br>

&nbsp; <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>&nbsp;&amp;

nbsp;&nbsp; d deaths per year&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

=&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 death per k minutes <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

525,600 minutes per year <br>

&nbsp; </p>



<p><a name="sol_5"></a>5. (a) $25,084 (b) False. Obviously there

were people who earned more than $50,000, say. (c) It's hard to

say. We need to know exactly how $25,084 was determined. Is it an

average? median? mode? There is not enough information given to

answer the question. (d) As in part c, how is this &quot;measure

of ncome&quot; determined? </p>



<p><a name="sol_6"></a>6. The &quot;50-50 chance&quot; statement

is a statistic that is often taken as &quot;certainty&quot; -

despite the word &quot;chance&quot;! Try tossing a coin 4 times.

What do get? Do it again. What do you get this time? **applet

here?** The answer is false because of chance. </p>



<p><a name="sol_7"></a>7. False. The playoff games are usually

played with more intensity which may increase or decrease a

player's shooting percentage. The shooting situations will not be

the same in the playoffs as in the regular season. This violates

the assumption of &quot;identical conditions&quot; in the law of

averages. (It is, in fact, violated during the regualr season.

Why?) </p>



<p align="left"><a name="sol_8"></a>8.&nbsp; One big question:

Did the studies involve Chinese subjects? If not, is there reason

to believe that the effects of the mutation(s) are independent of

race. The issue here is the design of the studies. </p>
