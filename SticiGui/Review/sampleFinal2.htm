    <li>Suppose I commute to work by bus or subway, depending on
        the weather. If it is sunny, I take the subway, but if it
        is raining, I take the bus. If I take the subway, I will
        be on time. If I take the bus and there is a traffic jam,
        I will be late. If there is no traffic jam, I will be on
        time.The unconditional daily chance of a traffic jam is 20%.
        Suppose I live in a part of the world that doesn't
        have seasons, and that the chance it is raining at the
        time in question is 10% every day. <br />
        The chance that I am on time<br />
        <br />
        a) is 0.2&times;0.9.<br />
        b) is 0.1&times;0.8.<br />
        c) is 0.9 + 0.1&times;0.8.<br />
        d) is 0.9 + 0.9&times;0.2.<br />
        e) cannot be calculated from the information given.<br />

    <li>A 5 card poker hand is &quot;jack high&quot; if it does <em>not</em>
        contain two or more of the same face, <strong>and</strong>
        not all 5 cards are the same suit, <strong>and</strong>
        the highest card in the hand is a jack. That is, all the
        cards have different faces, their 5 faces are not
        consecutive, not all 5 cards have the same suit, and the
        highest face is a jack. The face of a card is the number
        or picture on the card, without regard to the suit of the
        card. Suppose the order of the value of the faces of the
        cards is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, jack, queen, king,
        ace (aces are &quot;high&quot; only). The chance that in
        a 5-card hand dealt from a well shuffled standard deck of
        52 cards is &quot;jack high&quot; is closest to<br />
        <br />
        a) (4<sup>5</sup>-4)&times;<sub>9</sub>C<sub>4</sub>/(<sub>52</sub>C<sub>5</sub>)<br />

    <li>A researcher is developing genetic screening for a
        certain type of cancer. She has discovered that a certain
        genetic marker is associated with the cancer: 0.5% of the
        general population (including those with and without the
        genetic marker) are afflicted with this kind of cancer at
        some point in their lives, 0.1% of the general population
        have the genetic marker, and 20% of those with the
        genetic marker will eventually contract the disease. The
        researcher develops a genetic test that is 95% accurate:
        the chance that an individual with the marker tests
        positive for the marker is 95%, and the chance that an
        individual without the marker tests negative for the
        marker is 95%.<br />
        Among those who will get the cancer, the fraction who
        also have the genetic marker is closest to<br />
        <br />
        a) 90%.<br />
        b) 50%.<br />
        c) 30%.<br />
        d) 10%. <br />
        e) 5%. <br />
        <br />
        </li>
    <li>(Refers to the genetic screening question) The fraction
        of the general population (including those with and
        without the marker) that would be expected to test
        positive for the genetic marker is closest to <br />
        <br />
        a) 0.05%.<br />
        b) 0.1%.<br />
        c) 0.5%.<br />
        d) 1%.<br />
        e) 5%.<br />
        <br />
        </li>
    <li>(Refers to the genetic screening question) Among the
        general population, the fraction of individuals who both
        have the genetic marker, and will eventually contract the
        cancer, is closest to<br />
        <br />
        a) 0.02%.<br />
        b) 0.04%.<br />
        c) 0.06%.<br />

        </li>
    <li>(Refers to the genetic screening question) The
        conditional chance that an individual selected at random
        from the population really has the marker, given that he
        or she tests positive for the marker, is closest to<br />
        <br />
        a) 2%.<br />
        b) 20%.<br />
        c) 50%.<br />
        d) 70%<br />
        e) 90%.<br />

        Suppose that whether someone will eventually contract the
        disease is independent of whether the genetic test gives
        the correct result (the factors that affect whether the
        test is accurate for a given individual are different
        from those that affect whether or not the individual will
        contract the cancer). The conditional chance that someone
        will eventually contract the disease, given that he or
        she tests positive for the genetic marker, is closest to<br />
        <br />
        a) 1%<br />
        b) 10%<br />

    <li>Suppose that A and B are events. Which of the following
        is/are always true?<br />
        <br />
        i) the chance A occurs is (100% - chance A does not
        occur). <br />
        ii) the chance A and B both occur is the chance A occurs
        times the chance B occurs. <br />
        iii) the chance either A or B occurs is the chance A
        occurs plus the chance B occurs. <br />
        iv) the chance either A or B occurs is at most the chance
        A occurs plus the chance B occurs. <br />
        v) the chance that A and B both occur is the conditional
        chance that A occurs given that B occurs, times the
        chance that B occurs.<br />
        <br />
        a) all (i)-(v). <br />
        b) (i), (ii), (iii) and (v), but not (iv). <br />
        c) (i), (ii), (iv), and (v), but not (iii). <br />
        d) (i) and (ii), but none of (iii), (iv), and (v). <br />
        e) (i), (iv) and (v), but neither (ii) nor (iii)<br />

    <li>A box contains 5 tickets labeled with the numbers {-4,
        -1, 0, 2, 3}. In 100 random draws with replacement from
        the box, the expected value of the sum of just the <i>positive</i>
        numbers drawn is closest to<br />
        a) 0. <br />

    <li>A box contains tickets labeled with the numbers {-4, -1,
        0, 2, 3}. In 100 random draws with replacement from the
        box, the SE of the sum of just the <em>positive</em>
        numbers on the tickets drawn is closest to<br />
        a) 10&times;30<sup>½</sup> <br />
        b) 10&times;8<sup>½</sup> <br />
        c) 10&times;(1.6)<sup>½</sup><br />

    <li>Suppose I draw 10 tickets at random with replacement from
        a box of tickets, each of which is labeled with a number.
        The average of the numbers on the tickets is 1, and the
        SD of the numbers on the tickets is 1. Suppose I repeat
        this over and over, drawing 10 tickets at a time. Each
        time, I calculate the sum of the numbers on the 10
        tickets I draw. Consider the list of values of the sample
        sum, one for each sample I draw. This list gets an
        additional entry every time I draw 10 tickets.<br />
        <br />
        i) As the number of repetitions grows, the average of the
        list of sums is increasingly likely to be between 9.9 and
        10.1.<br />
        ii) As the number of repetitions grows, the histogram of
        the list of sums is likely to be approximated better and
        better by a normal curve (after converting the list to
        standard units).<br />
        iii) As the number of repetitions grows, the SD of the
        list of sums is increasingly likely to be between 0.9 and
        1.1.<br />
        <br />
        a) all are true.<br />
        b) all are false.<br />
        c) (i) is true, (ii) is false, (iii) is false.<br />
        d) (i) is false, (ii) is false, (iii) is true.<br />

    <li>A researcher wishes to determine the fraction of
        individuals with MBA degrees in executive positions in a
        certain large corporation. She obtains a complete list of
        the names of the executives; there are 1000. She takes a
        simple random sample of 100 of the executives to
        interview; 60 (60%) of them have MBA degrees. She
        estimates the number of executives with MBA degrees in
        the firm as a whole to be 60% of 1000 (namely, 600), with
        a standard error of <br />
        1000&times;SE(sample percentage) = 1000&times;(60%&times;40%)<sup>½</sup>/100<sup>½</sup>
        = 1000&times;4.9% = 49.<br />
        On the average, for estimates obtained this way, you
        would expect <br />
        <br />
        a) The estimated number of MBAs and the estimated SE to
        be about right.<br />
        b) The estimated number of MBAs and the estimated SE to
        be smaller than the true values.<br />
        c) The estimated number of MBAs and the estimated SE to
        be larger than the true values.<br />
        d) The estimated number of MBAs to be about right, and
        the estimated SE to be too small.<br />
        e) The estimated number of MBAs to be about right, and
        the estimated SE to be too large.<br />

    <li>Preparation H is a treatment for hemorrhoids. A TV
        advertisement for Preparation H reports that more people
        use Preparation H than use all the other leading brands
        combined, and that more people trust Preparation H. The
        viewer is &quot;invited&quot; to conclude that
        Preparation H is therefore the best hemorrhoid treatment
        on the market. This inference is dubious, for a variety
        of reasons. The most important is that<br />
        <br />
        a) It does not say whether the sample was random. <br />
        b) It does not say how big the sample was. <br />
        c) It does not report an SE for the sample percentages of
        people who use or who trust Preparation H. <br />
        d) The percentage of people who use or who trust
        Preparation H is a &quot;semi-attached figure.&quot; <br />
        e) It does not say whether the survey was performed by an
        independent survey organization. <br />

    <li>Someone I know claims to be able to spin a coin in such a
        way that he can make it land &quot;heads&quot; 90% of the
        time, on the average. I want to test the hypothesis that
        he's bluffing (that it's equally likely that the coin
        will land &quot;heads&quot; or &quot;tails&quot;) against
        the alternative that he is right. I propose to test this
        hypothesis by having him spin the coin again and again
        until it first lands &quot;tails.&quot; If it takes more
        than 4 tries, I'll conclude that he's right. Assume that
        the spins are independent.<br />
        <br />
        Under the null hypothesis that he cannot influence the
        outcome, the number of spins until the coin lands
        &quot;tails&quot; has a<br />
        <br />
        a) binomial distribution<br />
        b) geometric distribution<br />

    <li>I desire to estimate the percentage of homes in Berkeley,
        CA, that are assessed more than $3000 in annual property
        taxes. I obtain a list of all home addresses in Berkeley,
        and take a simple random sample of size 100 from the
        list, which contains several thousand addresses. I then
        contact the County Tax Assessor's office and obtain
        copies of the tax bills for those 100 properties. The
        sample percentage with tax bills over $3000 is 30%. An
        approximate 95% confidence interval for the percentage of

    <li>I want to test whether a particular headache remedy is
        effective. The null hypothesis is that it is not
        effective; the alternative hypothesis is that it is
        effective.<br />
        <br />
        a) A type I error occurs if the remedy does not work, and
        I reject the null hypothesis.<br />
        b) A type I error occurs if the remedy works, and I do
        not reject the null hypothesis.<br />
        c) A type I error occurs if the remedy works, and I
        reject the null hypothesis.<br />
        d) A type I error occurs if the remedy does not work, and
        I do not reject the null hypothesis.<br />
        e) A type II error occurs if the remedy does not work,
        and I reject the null hypothesis.<br />
        <br />
        </li>
    <li>(Refers to headache problem.) To test whether the
        headache remedy works, I propose a randomized,
        controlled, double-blind experiment: I will find 10
        volunteers who suffer regularly from headaches. Each will
        be given two pills, one of which is a placebo, and one of
        which contains the remedy I want to test. The pills are
        labeled &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B.&quot; The subjects are
        instructed to take pill &quot;A&quot; the first time they
        get a headache, and pill &quot;B&quot; the second time.
        They are to write down how long it took for their
        headache to abate each time, and report the result to me
        (assume that they do this perfectly accurately). For half
        the subjects, pill &quot;A&quot; is placebo and pill
        &quot;B&quot; is remedy; for the other half, it's the
        other way around. Which subjects get remedy first is
        decided randomly by assigning each subject a random
        number between zero and one. The 5 subjects who were
        assigned the largest random numbers get treatment first;
        the other 5 get placebo first.<br />
        <br />
        Of the two headaches each subject has during the study,
        one will last longer. It is reasonable to assume that if
        the remedy does not work, the longer headache would be
        equally likely to be either the remedy-treated headache
        or the placebo-treated headache. Assume also that if the
        remedy does not work, whether the remedy-treated or
        placebo-treated headache lasts longer is independent for
        different individuals.<br />
        Under these assumptions, if the remedy does not work, the
        number of subjects whose remedy-treated headaches are
        shorter than their placebo-treated headaches has<br />
        <br />
        a) a binomial distribution<br />
        b) a geometric distrinbution<br />
        c) an hypergeometric distribution<br />
        d) a negative binomial distribution<br />
        e) a normal distribution<br />
        <br />
        </li>
    <li>(Refers to headache problem) Suppose I reject the null
        hypothesis if for 9 or more of the subjects, the
        remedy-treated headache was shorter than the
        placebo-treated headache. The significance level of this
        test is closest to <br />
        <br />
        a) 0.1%<br />
        b) 1%<br />
        c) 2%<br />
        d) 5%<br />
        e) 10%<br />
        <br />
        </li>
    <li>(Refers to headache problem) Suppose that in reality, the
        remedy shortens about 50% of all headaches, so that for a
        given subject, the chance that the remedy-treated
        headache is shorter than the placebo-treated headache is

    <li>(Refers to headache problem) Suppose I perform the
        experiment, and for all 10 subjects, the remedy-treated
        headache is shorter than the placebo-treated headache.
        The <em>P</em>-value of the null hypothesis would be
        closest to<br />
        <br />
        a) 0.1%<br />

    <li>A researcher wishes to estimate some parameter from 5
        independent observations. Each observation is equal to
        the parameter the researcher wishes to estimate, plus
        chance error. The expected value of the chance error is
        zero (the measurements are unbiased), and the SE of the
        chance error (the variability in the measurement process)
        is known quite accurately from other experiments to be 1.
        To form a confidence interval for the parameter, with
        confidence level at least 95%, the researcher should use<br />
        <br />
        a) (sample mean of the observations) ± 2.<br />
        b) (sample mean of the observations) ± 4&times;5<sup>½</sup>.<br />
        c) (sample mean of the observations) ± 2/5<sup>½</sup>.<br />
        d) (sample mean of the observations) ± 2&times;(SD of the
        observations).<br />
        e) (sample mean of the observations) ± 2&times;(SD of the
        observations)/5<sup>½</sup>.<br />

    <li>A researcher wishes to determine the effect of dietary
        fat intake on serum (blood) cholesterol level. He takes
        random samples of 1,000 adults each from the populations
        of 80 countries, and makes a scatterplot of average serum
        cholesterol (milligrams per deciliter; mg/dl) versus
        average daily fat intake (in grams) for the countries
        (the scatterplot has 80 points, one for each country).
        The scatterplot is roughly football-shaped. The
        correlation coefficient between fat intake and serum
        cholesterol is 0.8. The regression line has slope 2
        (2mg/dl of serum cholesterol per gram of fat per day).<br />
        <br />
        i) For the sample, people who consume one less gram of
        fat per day than average have a serum cholesterol level
        about 2mg/dl less than average.<br />
        ii) An adult should expect that for each gram of fat he
        eliminates from his daily diet, his serum cholesterol
        level will fall by about 2 mg/dl.<br />
        iii) Because of ecological correlation, this study has
        little bearing on the effect of dietary fat on serum
        cholesterol for individuals.<br />
        iv) Because this is an observational study, one should
        not infer a causal relationship between dietary fat
        intake and serum cholesterol level from the observed
        association.<br />
        <br />
        a) All are true.<br />
        b) (i), (ii), and (iv) are true; (iii) is false.<br />
        c) (ii) and (iv) are true; (i) and (iii) are false.<br />
        d) (i) and (iv) are true; (ii) and (iii) are false.<br />
        e) (iii) and (iv) are true; (i) and (ii) are false.<br />

    <li>Box A contains 4 tickets labeled with the numbers {0, 0,
        0, 1}. Box B contains 4 tickets labeled with the numbers
        {3, 4, 5, 6}. Consider the normal approximation to the
        probability distribution of the sum of 10 draws with
        replacement from each of the boxes.<br />
        <br />
        a) The normal approximation to the sum of the draws from
        box A should have about the same accuracy as the normal
        approximation to the sum of the draws from box B.<br />
        b) The normal approximation to the sum of the draws from
        box A should have lower accuracy than the normal
        approximation to the sum of the draws from box B.<br />
        c) The normal approximation to the sum of the draws from
        box A should have higher accuracy than the normal
        approximation to the sum of the draws from box B.<br />
        d) The normal approximation should not be used, because
        the number of tickets in each box is too small.<br />
