   You need Java to see this.

</APPLET>

<p>

Venn diagrams are a way of visualizing sets.

This applet lets you highlight the set A, the set B, the set C, the universal set S,

the empty set {}, the complement of A (Ac), the complement of B (Bc),

the complement of C (Cc),

the intersection of A and B (AB), the union of A and B (A or B),

the intersection of the complement of A with B (AcB),

the intersection of A with the

complement of B (ABc),

the intersection of A, B, and C (ABC), the union of A, B, and C (A or B or C),

the intersection of Ac and B and C (AcBC), and the union of the complement of A and the

intersection of B and C (Ac or BC).

One can think of the relative area of a set to the area of S as a

probability.

The picture uses that analogy: the numbers P(A), P(B), and P(C) are proportional to

the area of A, the area of B, and the area of C, respectively; P(AB) is the area of the

intersection of A and B, and P(A or B) is the area of the union of A and B, etc.

</p>

<p>

You can drag the <a href="../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#event">events</a>

A, B, and C around, which changes the probability of their intersection

and of their union.

When A and B do not overlap, they are said to be

<a href="../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#disjoint">disjoint or mutually exclusive</a>.

When the probability of the intersection of A and B

equals the product

of the probability of A and the probability of B (when P(AB) = P(A)&times;P(B)),

A and B are

<a href="../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#independent">independent</a>.

Try to drag A or B to make P(AB) = P(A)&times;P(B);

notice how hard it is to make the overlap just

right: independence is a very special relationship between events.

For the collection of all three events, {A, B, C}, to be independent, one needs

P(AB) = P(A)&times;P(B), P(AC)=P(A)&times;P(C), P(BC) = P(B)&times;P(C),

and P(ABC)=P(A)&times;P(B)&times;P(C).

This is quite hard to arrange.

The scrollbars let you adjust the probability of A, the probability of

B, and the probability of C.

</p>

<p>

    The conditional probability of A given B, P(A|B), is defined to be

    P(AB)/P(B), provided P(B) is not zero.

    This applet displays six conditional probabilities: P(A|B), P(Ac|B), P(B|A),

    P(A|BC), P(Ac|BC), and P(A|(B or C)).

    When the corresponding checkbox is ticked, the events whose probabilities

    are involved in computing the conditional probability are highlighted in

    contrasting colors.
