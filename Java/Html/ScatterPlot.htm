</p>



<p>

This applet lets you study the relationship between pairs of

variables using <a href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#scatterplot">scatterplots</a>,

the <a href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#correlation_coef">correlation

coefficient</a>, the <a href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#graph_of_averages">graph

of averages</a>, <a href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#regression">linear

regression</a>, and <a href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#residual_plot">residual

plots</a>.

</p>



<p>You can select one of four data sets using the drop-down menu,

or <a href="#urlExpl">type in the URL of a different dataset</a>.

The four data sets are

</p>



<ul>

    <li><a href="#cities_data">data about the number of homeless

    in 50 cities in the USA</a> </li>

    <li><a href="#cities47_data">data about the 47 smallest of

    those 50 cities</a> </li>

    <li><a href="#ccv_data">pollutant emissions from EPA test

    vehicles in 96 tests</a> </li>

    <li><a href="#gmat_data">data about the GPAs and GMAT scores

    of 913 first year MBA students</a></li>

</ul>



<p>The next two choice boxes let you select which variable in the

selected data set to plot on the X axis, and which to plot on the

Y axis. <font color="#FF0000">Again, on monochrome monitors on

unix systems, the box itself might not be visible: click on the

name of the variable to see the other choices.</font> </p>



<p>The buttons should be self-explanatory. They let you plot ±1

SD from the <a href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#point_of_averages">point

of averages</a>, which is plotted in red; plot the

<a href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#sd_line">SD Line</a>, the

<a href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#graph_of_averages">graph

of averages</a> (yellow squares), and the

<a href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#regression">regression

line</a>, pop up a window containing the currently plotted

dataset, pop up a window containing summary statistics for each

variable, and toggle from a

<a href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#scatterplot">scatterplot</a>

of the data to a <a href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#residual">residual plot</a>,

use or ignore points you have added by clicking on the graph, and

clear points you added previously by clicking on the graph. (The

univariate summary statistics are always for the original data;

they do not include any points you have added.) You can find the

X and Y values for any point by positioning the mouse cursor over

it: the coordinates of the cursor are given in the lower right

corner of the applet. If you select some rows of data in the

dataset window and strike &quot;return,&quot; the corresponding

points in the scatterplot will be plotted in yellow, rather than

blue.</p>

<h2 align="center">Description of the Data Sets</h2>



<p><a name="cities_data"><strong>Cities data</strong></a>. These

data come from a September 25, 1987, article by W. Tucker in the

National Review. Mr. Tucker presented the results of analyses by

Prof. Jeffrey Simonoff of the Department of Statistics and

Operations Research, Stern School of Business, New York

University. The &quot;conceivably relevant factors&quot; Prof.

Simonoff considered in studying the the homeless rate per

thousand population were the population size, vacancy rate, and

unemployment rate, in 50 cities in the USA. The homeless figures

for 35 of the cities came from the 1984 Report to the Secretary

of Housing and Urban Development on Emergency Shelters and

Homeless Populations. The homeless data for the other 15 cities

(St. Louis, Santa Monica, Newark, Yonkers, Dallas-Fort Worth,

Denver, Charleston WV, Atlanta, San Diego, New Orleans,

Albuquerque, Tucson, Burlington, Milwaukee, Providence, and

Lincoln NE) were from local sources, and were chosen because 1987

or 1988 homeless estimates for those cities happened to be

available. The other data for those cities came from various

federal agencies, such as the Census Bureau, HUD, and the NOAA

(Prof. J. Simonoff, personal communication, 1998.).

The <a name="cities47_data">cities47 data set excludes the largest three

of the 50 cities. </a></p>



<p><a name="ccv_data"></a><strong>CCV data</strong>. The

Correlation Check Vehicle (CCV) data were made available by Leo

Breiman, Department of Statistics, UCB. The data were collected

by the Environmental Protection Agency. The test vehicles are

1977 Chevrolet Novas, modified in various ways, including the

removal of their catalytic converters and other emissions-control

systems. These data were collected in 1979 at a single

laboratory, and used constant engine load and fuel temperature.

The measured variables are the emissions of hydrocarbons (HC),

nitrogen oxides (NOx), and carbon monoxide (CO), measured in

milligrams per mile. Three outliers whose cause was known were

removed from the data set; 96 measurements of each of the three

variables remain. &quot;Test&quot; is just a number that

identifies the case, not a measurement. </p>



<p><a name="gmat_data"></a><strong>GMAT data</strong>. These data

were made available by Howard Wainer, Educational Testing

Service. The data are the undergraduate GPA's, verbal and

quantitative GMAT scores, and first-year MBA GPA's of 913

students from five major universities. I do not know how the

students were selected, nor do I know the year of the study. </p>

<p>

<a name="urlExpl"></a>Give the URL of a file on the web. The file

should be in the following format:

</p>



<ol>

    <li>The first line has the variable names, separated by tabs or spaces.

    Complicated names that contain spaces can be surrounded with quotation

    marks. If a line contains two slashes (//), everything from the

    slashes to the end of the line is ignored---it is a comment.</li>

    <li> the remaining lines contain the data, separated by spaces or tabs.

    The order of the data should be every variable for the first case,

    then every variable for the second case, etc., up to the last case.

    Again, everything in a line after two slashes is ignored.

    </li>

</ol>
