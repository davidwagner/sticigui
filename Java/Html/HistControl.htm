<p>

    This applet lets you take &quot;slices&quot; through a

    multivariate data set to compare the distribution of a variable

    without regard for the values of the other variables with the

    distribution of that variable when the value of one or more of

    the other variables is restricted to some range; that is, the

    distribution for just those individuals in the data set for which

    the other variables are all in the specified ranges.

</p>



<p>

    The blue histogram (yellow when highlighted) shows the

    distribution of the selected variable for the entire data set.

    The green histogram (magenta when highlighted) shows the

    distribution of the selected variable for only those members of

    the population whose measurement on other variables are in the

    ranges specified near the bottom of the applet. The means and SDs

    of the overall and restricted values, as well as the overall

    number of individuals and the number in the restricted group, are

    given at the bottom. Using the scrollbars or text entry areas,

    you can select a range of values and see how the area of the

    histograms the selected range differs between the restricted and

    unrestricted groups; you can also see the normal curves (blue for

    the blue histogram; green for the green histogram) and the area

    under the normal curve corresponding to the selected region of

    the histograms.

</p>



<p>

The bins are plotted in such a way that if both the

unrestricted and restricted histograms have a positive height in

a given class interval, the shorter one is &quot;in front,&quot;

so that you see the taller one sticking up beyond it. If the two

have exactly the same height in a given bin, the restricted one

(green or magenta, depending on whether or not it is highlighted)

plots in front, so only it is visible.

</p>



<p>You can select one of three data sets, <a

href="ScatterPlot.htm#ccv_data">CCV (emissions of EPA test

vehicles in 96 tests)</a>, <a href="ScatterPlot.htm#cities_data">Cities

(homeless rates and several other variables possibly related to

homelessness for 50 cities)</a>, and <a

href="ScatterPlot.htm#gmat_data">GMAT (GMAT scores, undergraduate

GPAs and first-year MBA GPAs for 913 students)</a>. From each

data set you can choose a histogram of one of several variables,

and you can superpose the histogram of that variable for just

those cases where it and other variables are in specified ranges.

It is interesting to compare such slices with

scatterplots of these variables.</p>



<h2 align="center">Explanation of the Applet Controls</h2>



<p align="left">The choice boxes

above the histogram allow you to choose

which data set to look at, and which variable in that data set to

plot a histogram of. The check boxes above the histogram

control whether the histogram

of the original, unrestricted data is plotted (blue in the

unhighlighted regions and yellow where highlighted), and/or the

histogram of the data that remain after the restrictions are

applied (green in the unhighlighted regions and magenta where

highlighted).</p>



<p align="left">The three text boxes and scroll bars just under

the histogram control the lower endpoint of the range to

highlight, the upper endpoint of the range to highlight, and the

number of bins in the histogram, respectively. You can either use

the scrollbars to change the values, or type a new value into the

box, followed by the &quot;return&quot; or &quot;enter&quot; key.</p>



<p align="left">

In the next row of controls, the button controls

whether or not normal curves are superposed on the histograms; if

so, the areas under the normal curves for the highlighted parts

of the histograms are displayed. The highlighted areas of the

histograms themselves are always displayed.

</p>





<p>

    The next row of controls allows you to select

    other variables in the current dataset to apply restrictions to,

    and show the histogram of the value of the variable selected on

    the previous line, but for only those individuals whose

    measurements of the variables restricted on this line fall in the

    specified ranges. The first check box specifies

    whether or not you want to restrict the variable selected on this

    line to be larger than some threshold; the threshold is displayed

    in the text area just to the right of &quot;&gt;=&quot;. You can

    change the threshold by typing in a new value, then striking the

    &quot;enter&quot; or &quot;return&quot; key. The next check box

    specifies whether or not you want to constrain the variable

    selected on this line to be less than the threshold value

    displayed in the text area just to the right of

    &quot;&lt;=.&quot; Again, you can change the threshold value by

    typing over it and striking &quot;return&quot; or

    &quot;enter.&quot; The histogram of the remaining values of the

    variable selected on the previous line, after the restrictions

    are applies, is shown in green (magenta where highlighted). Note

    that any restrictions you apply persist when you select a

    different variable on this line; you have to clear them

    individually, or all at once using the &quot;clear

    restrictions&quot; button, which unchecks all the check boxes for

    all the variables, and resets the threshold values to the minimum

    and maximum values of each variable.

</p>



<p>

    The button on the bottom line pops up a

    new window that lists the current dataset.

    The rest of the bottom line shows the number of

    original observations of the variable plotted, the mean and sd of

    those values, the number of observations that remain after the

    restrictions are applied, and the mean and sd of those

    observations.
