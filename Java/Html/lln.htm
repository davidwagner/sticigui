<p>

The <a href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#law_of_large_numbers">Law

of Large Numbers</a> says that in repeated, independent trials with

the same probability <em>p</em> of success in each trial, the chance that

the percentage of successes differs from the probability <em>p</em> by

more than a fixed positive amount, <em>e</em> > 0, converges to zero

as the number

of trials <em>n</em> goes to infinity, for every positive <em>e</em>.

Note two things:

</P>

<p>

<ol>

<li> The difference between the number of successes and the number of

trials times the chance of success in each trial (the expected number

of successes) tends to <strong>grow</strong> as the number of trials

increases. (In fact, this difference tends to grow like the square-root

of the number of trials.)

</li>

<li>

Although the chance of a large difference between the percentage of successes

and the chance of success gets smaller and smaller as <em>n</em>

grows, nothing prevents the difference from being large in some sequences

of trials.

The assumption that this difference always tends to zero, as opposed to

this difference having a large probability of being arbitrarily close to

zero, is the difference between the

<a href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#law_of_large_numbers">Law

of Large Numbers</a>, which is a mathematical theorem, and the

<a href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#empirical_law_of_averages">Empirical

Law

of Averages</a>, which is an assumption about how the world works that

lies at the base of the

<a href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#frequency_theory">Frequency

Theory</a> of probability.

</li>

</ol>

</p>

<p>

The distribution of the number of successes in <em>n</em> independent

trials with probability <em>p</em> of success in each trial is

<a href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#binomial">Binomial</a>,

with parameters <em>n</em> and <em>p</em>.

<p>

The controls on this applet let you change the number of trials, the

probability of success in each trial, and toggle between viewing either

the

difference between the number of successes and the expected number

of successes, or the difference between the percentage of successes

and the probability of success in each trial.
